**kit**: n.

[Usenet; poss.: fr.: `*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ slang for a full software
distribution, as opposed to a patch or upgrade] A source software
distribution that has been packaged in such a way that it can
(theoretically) be unpacked and installed according to a series of steps
using only standard Unix tools, and entirely documented by some
reasonable chain of references from the top-level `*README
file* <../R/README-file.html>`__. The more general term
`*distribution* <../D/distribution.html>`__ may imply that special tools
or more stringent conditions on the host environment are required.
