**ken**: /ken/, n.

1. [Unix] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of Unix. In the early days he
used to hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note that read “Love,
ken”. Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes uncapitalized,
because it's a login name and mail address) in third-person reference;
it is widely understood (on Usenet, in particular) that without a last
name ‘Ken’ refers only to Ken Thompson. Similarly, ‘Dennis’ without last
name means Dennis Ritchie (and he is often known as ``dmr``). See also
`*demigod* <../D/demigod.html>`__, `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__.

2. A flaming user. This was originated by the Software Support group at
Symbolics because the two greatest flamers in the user community were
both named Ken.
