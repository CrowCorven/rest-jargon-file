**Jeff K.**

The spiritual successor to `*B1FF* <../B/B1FF.html>`__ and the archetype
of `*script kiddies* <../S/script-kiddies.html>`__. Jeff K. is a
sixteen-year-old suburbanite who fancies himself a “l33t haX0r”,
although his knowledge of computers seems to be limited to the procedure
for getting Quake up and running. His Web page
`http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/ <http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/>`__
features a number of hopelessly naive articles, essays, and rants, all
filled with the kind of misspellings,
`*studlycaps* <../S/studlycaps.html>`__, and number-for-letter
substitutions endemic to the script kiddie and `*warez
d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__ communities. Jeff's offerings, among
other things, include hardware advice (such as “AMD VERSIS PENTIUM” and
“HOW TO OVARCLOAK YOUR COMPUTAR”), his own Quake clan (Clan 40 OUNSCE),
and his own comic strip (Wacky Fun Computar Comic Jokes).

Like B1FF, Jeff K. is (fortunately) a hoax. Jeff K. was created by
internet game journalist Richard “Lowtax” Kyanka, whose web site
Something Awful (http://www.somethingawful.com) highlights
unintentionally humorous news items and Web sites, as a parody of the
kind of teenage `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__ who infests Quake servers,
chat rooms, and other places where computer enthusiasts congregate. He
is well-recognized in the PC game community and his influence has spread
to hacker `*fora* <../F/fora.html>`__ like Slashdot as well.
