**jello**: n.

[Usenet: by analogy with `*spam* <../S/spam.html>`__] A message that is
both excessively cross-posted and too frequently posted, as opposed to
`*spam* <../S/spam.html>`__ (which is merely too frequently posted) or
`*velveeta* <../V/velveeta.html>`__ (which is merely excessively
cross-posted). This term is widely recognized but not commonly used;
most people refer to both kinds of abuse or their combination as spam.
