**job security**: n.

When some piece of code is written in a particularly
`*obscure* <../O/obscure.html>`__ fashion, and no good reason (such as
time or space optimization) can be discovered, it is often said that the
programmer was attempting to increase his job security (i.e., by making
himself indispensable for maintenance). This sour joke seldom has to be
said in full; if two hackers are looking over some code together and one
points at a section and says “job security”, the other one may just nod.
