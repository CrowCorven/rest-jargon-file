**JCL**: /J·C·L/, n.

1. IBM's supremely `*rude* <../R/rude.html>`__ Job Control Language. JCL
is the script language used to control the execution of programs in
IBM's batch systems. JCL has a very `*fascist* <../F/fascist.html>`__
syntax, and some versions will, for example, `*barf* <../B/barf.html>`__
if two spaces appear where it expects one. Most programmers confronted
with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the file
names. Someone who actually understands and generates unique JCL is
regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who memorizes the
phone book. It is reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing
“Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles you and me? I-B-M, J-C-L,
M-o-u-s-e” to the tune of the *Mickey Mouse Club* theme to express their
opinion of the beast.

2. A comparative for any very `*rude* <../R/rude.html>`__ software that
a hacker is expected to use. “That's as bad as JCL.” As with
`*COBOL* <../C/COBOL.html>`__, JCL is often used as an archetype of
ugliness even by those who haven't experienced it. See also
`*IBM* <../I/IBM.html>`__, `*fear and
loathing* <../F/fear-and-loathing.html>`__.

A (poorly documented, naturally) shell simulating JCL syntax is
available at the Retrocomputing Museum
