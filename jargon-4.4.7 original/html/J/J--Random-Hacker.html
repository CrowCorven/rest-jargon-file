**J. Random Hacker**: /J rand´m hak´r/, n.

[very common] A mythical figure like the Unknown Soldier; the archetypal
hacker nerd. This term is one of the oldest in the jargon, apparently
going back to MIT in the 1960s. See `*random* <../R/random.html>`__,
`*Suzie COBOL* <../S/Suzie-COBOL.html>`__. This may originally have been
inspired by ‘J. Fred Muggs’, a show-biz chimpanzee whose name was a
household word back in the early days of `*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__,
and was probably influenced by ‘J. Presper Eckert’ (one of the
co-inventors of the electronic computer). See also `*Fred
Foobar* <../F/Fred-Foobar.html>`__.
