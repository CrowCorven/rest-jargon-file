**initgame**: /in·it´gaym/, n.

[IRC] An `*IRC* <IRC.html>`__ version of the trivia game “Botticelli”,
in which one user changes his `*nick* <../N/nick.html>`__ to the
initials of a famous person or other named entity, and the others on the
channel ask yes or no questions, with the one to guess the person
getting to be “it” next. As a courtesy, the one picking the initials
starts by providing a 4-letter hint of the form sex, nationality,
life-status, reality-status. For example, MAAR means “Male, American,
Alive, Real” (as opposed to “fictional”). Initgame can be surprisingly
addictive. See also `*hing* <../H/hing.html>`__.

[1996 update: a recognizable version of the initgame has become a staple
of some radio talk shows in the U.S. We had it first! -- ESR]
