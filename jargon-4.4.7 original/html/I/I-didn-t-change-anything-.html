**I didn't change anything!**: interj.

An aggrieved cry often heard as bugs manifest during a regression test.
The `*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ reply to this assertion is
“Then it works just the same as it did before, doesn't it?” See also
`*one-line fix* <../O/one-line-fix.html>`__. This is also heard from
applications programmers trying to blame an obvious applications problem
on an unrelated systems software change, for example a divide-by-0 fault
after terminals were added to a network. Usually, their statement is
found to be false. Upon close questioning, they will admit some major
restructuring of the program that shouldn't have broken anything, in
their opinion, but which actually `*hosed* <../H/hosed.html>`__ the code
completely.
