**interrupts locked out**: adj.

When someone is ignoring you. In a restaurant, after several fruitless
attempts to get the waitress's attention, a hacker might well observe
“She must have interrupts locked out”. The synonym interrupts disabled
is also common. Variations abound; “to have one's interrupt mask bit
set” and “interrupts masked out” are also heard. See also
`*spl* <../S/spl.html>`__.
