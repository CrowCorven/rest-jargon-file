**installfest**

[Linux community since c.1998] Common portmanteau word for “installation
festival”; Linux user groups frequently run these. Computer users are
invited to bring their machines to have Linux installed on their
machines. The idea is to get them painlessly over the biggest hump in
migrating to Linux, which is initially installing and configuring it for
the user's machine.
