**infant mortality**: n.

It is common lore among hackers (and in the electronics industry at
large; this term is possibly techspeak by now) that the chances of
sudden hardware failure drop off exponentially with a machine's time
since first use (that is, until the relatively distant time at which
enough mechanical wear in I/O devices and thermal-cycling stress in
components has accumulated for the machine to start going senile). Up to
half of all chip and wire failures happen within a new system's first
few weeks; such failures are often referred to as infant mortality
problems (or, occasionally, as sudden infant death syndrome). See

period* <../B/burn-in-period.html>`__.
