**Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!**: prov.

[Usenet] Since `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ first got off the ground
in 1980--81, it has grown exponentially, approximately doubling in size
every year. On the other hand, most people feel the `*signal-to-noise
ratio* <../S/signal-to-noise-ratio.html>`__ of Usenet has dropped
steadily. These trends led, as far back as mid-1983, to predictions of
the imminent collapse (or death) of the net. Ten years and numerous
doublings later, enough of these gloomy prognostications have been
confounded that the phrase “Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!” has
become a running joke, hauled out any time someone grumbles about the
`*S/N ratio* <../S/S-N-ratio.html>`__ or the huge and steadily
increasing volume, or the possible loss of a key node or link, or the
potential for lawsuits when ignoramuses post copyrighted material, etc.,
etc., etc.
