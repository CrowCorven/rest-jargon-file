**lamer**: n.

[originally among Amiga fans]

1. Synonym for `*luser* <luser.html>`__, not used much by hackers but
common among `*warez d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__, crackers, and
`*phreaker* <../P/phreaker.html>`__\ s. A person who downloads much, but
who never uploads. (Also known as leecher). Oppose
`*elite* <../E/elite.html>`__. Has the same connotations of
self-conscious elitism that use of `*luser* <luser.html>`__ does among
hackers.

2. Someone who tries to crack a BBS.

3. Someone who annoys the sysop or other BBS users — for instance, by
posting lots of silly messages, uploading virus-ridden software,
frequently dropping carrier, etc.

Crackers also use it to refer to cracker
`*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__\ s. In phreak culture, a lamer is
one who scams codes off others rather than doing cracks or really
understanding the fundamental concepts. In `*warez
d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__ culture, where the ability to wave
around cracked commercial software within days of (or before) release to
the commercial market is much esteemed, the lamer might try to upload
garbage or shareware or something incredibly old (old in this context is
read as a few years to anything older than 3 days). ‘Lamer’ is also much
used in the IRC world in a similar sense to the above.

This term seems to have originated in the Commodore-64 scene in the mid
1980s. It was popularized among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s by
‘Lamer Exterminator’, the most famous and feared Amiga virus ever, which
gradually corrupted non-write-protected floppy disks with bad sectors.
The bad sectors, when looked at, were overwritten with repetitions of
the string “LAMER!”.
