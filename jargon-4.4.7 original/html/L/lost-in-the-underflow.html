**lost in the underflow**: adj.

Too small to be worth considering; more specifically, small beyond the
limits of accuracy or measurement. This is a reference to floating
underflow, a condition that can occur when a floating-point arithmetic
processor tries to handle quantities smaller than its limit of
magnitude. It is also a pun on ‘undertow’ (a kind of fast, cold current
that sometimes runs just offshore and can be dangerous to swimmers).
“Well, sure, photon pressure from the stadium lights alters the path of
a thrown baseball, but that effect gets lost in the underflow.” Compare
`*epsilon* <../E/epsilon.html>`__, `*epsilon
squared* <../E/epsilon-squared.html>`__; see also `*overflow
bit* <../O/overflow-bit.html>`__.
