**lint**

[from Unix's lint(1), named for the bits of fluff it supposedly picks
from programs]

1. vt. To examine a program closely for style, language usage, and
portability problems, esp. if in C, esp. if via use of automated
analysis tools, most esp. if the Unix utility lint(1) is used. This term
used to be restricted to use of lint(1) itself, but (judging by
references on Usenet) it has become a shorthand for any exhaustive
review process at some non-Unix shops, even in languages other than C.
Also as v. `*delint* <../D/delint.html>`__.

2. n. Excess verbiage in a document, as in “This draft has too much
lint”.
