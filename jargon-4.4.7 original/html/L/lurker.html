**lurker**: n.

One of the ‘silent majority’ in an electronic forum; one who posts
occasionally or not at all but is known to read the group's postings
regularly. This term is not pejorative and indeed is casually used
reflexively: “Oh, I'm just lurking.” Often used in the lurkers, the
hypothetical audience for the group's
`*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__-emitting regulars. When a lurker
speaks up for the first time, this is called delurking.

The creator of the popular science-fiction TV series *Babylon 5* has
ties to SF fandom and the hacker culture. In that series, the use of the
term ‘lurker’ for a homeless or displaced person is a conscious
reference to the jargon term.
