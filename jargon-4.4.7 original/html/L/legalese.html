**legalese**: n.

Dense, pedantic verbiage in a language description, product
specification, or interface standard; text that seems designed to
obfuscate and requires a `*language lawyer* <language-lawyer.html>`__ to
`*parse* <../P/parse.html>`__ it. Though hackers are not afraid of high
information density and complexity in language (indeed, they rather
enjoy both), they share a deep and abiding loathing for legalese; they
associate it with deception, `*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__\ s, and
situations in which hackers generally get the short end of the stick.
