**larval stage**: n.

Describes a period of monomaniacal concentration on coding apparently
passed through by all fledgling hackers. Common symptoms include the
perpetration of more than one 36-hour `*hacking
run* <../H/hacking-run.html>`__ in a given week; neglect of all other
activities including usual basics like food, sleep, and personal
hygiene; and a chronic case of advanced bleary-eye. Can last from 6
months to 2 years, the apparent median being around 18 months. A few so
afflicted never resume a more ‘normal’ life, but the ordeal seems to be
necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed to merely competent)
programmers. See also `*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__. A less
protracted and intense version of larval stage (typically lasting about
a month) may recur when one is learning a new `*OS* <../O/OS.html>`__ or
programming language.
