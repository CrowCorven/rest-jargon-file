**line 666**

[from Christian eschatological myth] n. The notional line of source at
which a program fails for obscure reasons, implying either that
*somebody* is out to get it (when you are the programmer), or that it
richly deserves to be so gotten (when you are not). “It works when I
trace through it, but seems to crash on line 666 when I run it.” “What
happens is that whenever a large batch comes through, mmdf dies on the
Line of the Beast. Probably some twit hardcoded a buffer size.”
