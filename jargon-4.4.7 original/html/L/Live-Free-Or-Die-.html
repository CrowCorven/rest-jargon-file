**Live Free Or Die!**: imp.

1. The state motto of New Hampshire, which appears on that state's
automobile license plates.

2. A slogan associated with Unix in the romantic days when Unix
aficionados saw themselves as a tiny, beleaguered underground tilting
against the windmills of industry. The “free” referred specifically to
freedom from the `*fascist* <../F/fascist.html>`__ design philosophies
and crufty misfeatures common on competing operating systems. Armando
Stettner, one of the early Unix developers, used to give out fake
license plates bearing this motto under a large Unix, all in New
Hampshire colors of green and white. These are now valued collector's
items. In 1994 `*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ put an inferior imitation of
these in circulation with a red corporate logo added. Compaq (half of
which was once DEC) continued the practice.
