**LAN party**: /lan par´tee/

An event to which several users bring their boxes and hook them up to a
common LAN (Local Area Network), often for the purpose of playing
multiplayer computer games, especially action games such as Quake or
Unreal Tournament. This is also a good venue for people to show-off
their fancy new hardware. Such events can get pretty large, several
hundred people attend the annual QuakeCon in Texas. The theoretical
rationale behind LAN parties is that playing over the Internet often
introduces too much lag in the playing experience — but just as
important is the special quality of trash-talking each other across the
room while playing, and the instinctive social ritual of consuming vast
amounts of food and drink together.
