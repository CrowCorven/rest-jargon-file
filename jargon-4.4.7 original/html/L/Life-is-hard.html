**Life is hard**: prov.

[XEROX PARC] This phrase has two possible interpretations: (1) “While
your suggestion may have some merit, I will behave as though I hadn't
heard it.” (2) “While your suggestion has obvious merit, equally obvious
circumstances prevent it from being seriously considered.” The charm of
the phrase lies precisely in this subtle but important ambiguity.
