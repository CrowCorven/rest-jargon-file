<div class="section" id="overgeneralization">
<h1>Overgeneralization<a class="headerlink" href="#overgeneralization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A very conspicuous feature of jargon is the frequency with which
techspeak items such as names of program tools, command language
primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside
of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them. Thus (to
cite one of the best-known examples) Unix hackers often
<a class="reference external" href="G/grep.html">*grep*</a> for things rather than searching for them. Many
of the lexicon entries are generalizations of exactly this kind.</p>
<p>Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well. Many
hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to them to
make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to nonuniform
cases (or vice versa). For example, because porous → porosity and
generous → generosity, hackers happily generalize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>mysterious → mysteriosity</li>
<li>ferrous → ferrosity</li>
<li>obvious → obviosity</li>
<li>dubious → dubiosity</li>
</ul>
<p>Another class of common construction uses the suffix ‘-itude’ to
abstract a quality from just about any adjective or noun. This usage
arises especially in cases where mainstream English would perform the
same abstraction through ‘-iness’ or ‘-ingness’. Thus:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>win → winnitude (a common exclamation)</li>
<li>loss → lossitude</li>
<li>cruft → cruftitude</li>
<li>lame → lameitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for
example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be called
‘lats’ — after all, they&#8217;re measuring latitude!</p>
<p>Also, note that all nouns can be verbed. E.g.: “All nouns can be
verbed”, “I&#8217;ll mouse it up”, “Hang on while I clipboard it over”, “I&#8217;m
grepping the files”. English as a whole is already heading in this
direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are
simply a bit ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>The suffix “-full” can also be applied in generalized and fanciful ways,
as in “As soon as you have more than one cachefull of data, the system
starts thrashing,” or “As soon as I have more than one headfull of
ideas, I start writing it all down.” A common use is “screenfull”,
meaning the amount of text that will fit on one screen, usually in text
mode where you have no choice as to character size. Another common form
is “bufferfull”.</p>
<p>However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques
characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a hacker
would never, for example, ‘productize’, ‘prioritize’, or ‘securitize’
things. Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic bafflegab and
regard those who use it with contempt.</p>
<p>Similarly, all verbs can be nouned. This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it is good
form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way. Thus:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>win → winnitude, winnage</li>
<li>disgust → disgustitude</li>
<li>hack → hackification</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms. Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary includes
an entry which implies that the plural of ‘mouse’ is
<a class="reference external" href="M/meeces.html">*meeces*</a>, and notes that the defined plural of
‘caboose’ is ‘cabeese’. This latter has apparently been standard (or at
least a standard joke) among railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many
years</p>
<p>On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in ‘x’ may form
plurals in ‘-xen’ (see <a class="reference external" href="V/VAXen.html">*VAXen*</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="B/boxen.html">*boxen*</a> in the main text). Even words ending in
phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this way; e.g., ‘soxen’ for a
bunch of socks. Other funny plurals are the Hebrew-style ‘frobbotzim’
for the plural of ‘frobbozz’ (see <a class="reference external" href="F/frobnitz.html">*frobnitz*</a>) and
‘Unices’ and ‘Twenices’ (rather than ‘Unixes’ and ‘Twenexes’; see
<a class="reference external" href="U/Unix.html">*Unix*</a>, <a class="reference external" href="T/TWENEX.html">*TWENEX*</a> in main text).
But note that ‘Twenexen’ was never used, and ‘Unixen’ was seldom sighted
in the wild until the year 2000, thirty years after it might logically
have come into use; it has been suggested that this is because ‘-ix’ and
‘-ex’ are Latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural. Among
Perl hackers it is reported that ‘comma’ and ‘semicolon’ pluralize as
‘commata’ and ‘semicola’ respectively. Finally, it has been suggested to
general approval that the plural of ‘mongoose’ ought to be ‘polygoose’.</p>
<p>The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either an
import or a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending ‘-im’, or the
Anglo-Saxon plural suffix ‘-en’) to cases where it isn&#8217;t normally
considered to apply.</p>
<p>This is not ‘poor grammar’, as hackers are generally quite well aware of
what they are doing when they distort the language. It is grammatical
creativity, a form of playfulness. It is done not to impress but to
amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.</p>
