<h1>Hacker Slang and Hacker Culture<a class="headerlink" href="#hacker-slang-and-hacker-culture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document is a collection of slang terms used by various subcultures
of computer hackers. Though some technical material is included for
background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary; what we
describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for fun,
social communication, and technical debate.</p>
<p>The ‘hacker culture’ is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values. It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams. Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of ‘normal’ values and working habits, it
has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional culture
less than 50 years old.</p>
<p>As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold places
in the community and expresses shared values and experiences. Also as
usual, <em>not</em> knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately) defines one
as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish vocabulary)
possibly even a <a class="reference external" href="S/suit.html">*suit*</a>. All human cultures use slang
in this threefold way — as a tool of communication, and of inclusion,
and of exclusion.</p>
<p>Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps in
the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard to
detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are code
for shared states of <em>consciousness</em>. There is a whole range of altered
states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level hacking
which don&#8217;t fit into conventional linguistic reality any better than a
Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher&#8217;s surreal <em>trompe l&#8217;oeil</em>
compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker slang encodes
these subtleties in many unobvious ways. As a simple example, take the
distinction between a <a class="reference external" href="K/kluge.html">*kluge*</a> and an
<a class="reference external" href="E/elegant.html">*elegant*</a> solution, and the differing connotations
attached to each. The distinction is not only of engineering
significance; it reaches right back into the nature of the generative
processes in program design and asserts something important about two
different kinds of relationship between the hacker and the hack. Hacker
slang is unusually rich in implications of this kind, of overtones and
undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche.</p>
<p>Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive
in their use of language. These traits seem to be common in young
children, but the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an
educational system bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence.
Thus, linguistic invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a
halting and largely unconscious process. Hackers, by contrast, regard
slang formation and use as a game to be played for conscious pleasure.
Their inventions thus display an almost unique combination of the
neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the discrimination of educated
and powerful intelligence. Further, the electronic media which knit them
together are fluid, ‘hot’ connections, well adapted to both the
dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and
superannuated specimens. The results of this process give us perhaps a
uniquely intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.</p>
<p>Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and anthropological
assumptions. For example, in the early 1990s it became fashionable to
speak of ‘low-context’ versus ‘high-context’ communication, and to
classify cultures by the preferred context level of their languages and
art forms. It is usually claimed that low-context communication
(characterized by precision, clarity, and completeness of self-contained
utterances) is typical in cultures which value logic, objectivity,
individualism, and competition; by contrast, high-context communication
(elliptical, emotive, nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is
associated with cultures which value subjectivity, consensus,
cooperation, and tradition. What then are we to make of hackerdom, which
is themed around extremely low-context interaction with computers and
exhibits primarily “low-context” values, but cultivates an almost
absurdly high-context slang style?</p>
<p>The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a compilation
of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the surrounding
culture — and, in fact, this one is the latest version of an evolving
compilation called the ‘Jargon File’, maintained by hackers themselves
since the early 1970s. This one (like its ancestors) is primarily a
lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect background or
sidelight information on hacker culture that would be awkward to try to
subsume under individual slang definitions.</p>
<p>Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that the
material be enjoyable to browse. Even a complete outsider should find at
least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is amusingly
thought-provoking. But it is also true that hackers use humorous
wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements about what they
feel. Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in
disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this is deliberate. We
have not tried to moderate or pretty up these disputes; rather we have
attempted to ensure that <em>everyone&#8217;s</em> sacred cows get gored,
impartially. Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue, but the
honest presentation of divergent viewpoints is.</p>
<p>The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them. We have not felt it
either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document&#8217;s major intended audiences —
fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture — will benefit from
them.</p>
<p>A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included in
<a class="reference external" href="appendixa.html">Appendix A</a>. The ‘outside’ reader&#8217;s attention is
particularly directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in <a class="reference external" href="appendixb.html">Appendix
B</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="pt03.html#bibliography">Bibliography</a>,
lists some non-technical works which have either influenced or described
the hacker culture.</p>
<p>Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between description and influence can become more than a little blurred.
Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central role in
spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to
successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one
will do likewise.</p>
