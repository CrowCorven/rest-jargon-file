<h1>Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak<a class="headerlink" href="#of-slang-jargon-and-techspeak" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Linguists usually refer to informal language as ‘slang’ and reserve the
term ‘jargon’ for the technical vocabularies of various occupations.
However, the ancestor of this collection was called the ‘Jargon File’,
and hacker slang is traditionally ‘the jargon’. When talking about the
jargon there is therefore no convenient way to distinguish it from what
a <em>linguist</em> would call hackers&#8217; jargon — the formal vocabulary they
learn from textbooks, technical papers, and manuals.</p>
<p>To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,
and shifts over time. Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do
not speak or recognize hackish slang.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>slang</dt>
<dd>informal language from mainstream English or non-technical
subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).</dd>
<dt>jargon</dt>
<dd>without qualifier, denotes informal ‘slangy’ language peculiar to or
predominantly found among hackers — the subject of this lexicon.</dd>
<dt>techspeak</dt>
<dd>the formal technical vocabulary of programming, computer science,
electronics, and other fields connected to hacking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon.</p>
<p>The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one. A lot of techspeak
originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing uptake of jargon
into techspeak. On the other hand, a lot of jargon arises from
overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about this in the
<a class="reference external" href="construction.html">Jargon Construction</a> section below).</p>
<p>In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicate
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical
dictionaries, or standards documents.</p>
<p>A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems, languages,
or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that
isn&#8217;t covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey critical
historical background necessary to understand other entries to which
they are cross-referenced. Some other techspeak senses of jargon words
are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear; where the text does
not specify that a straight technical sense is under discussion, these
are marked with ‘[techspeak]’ as an etymology. Some entries have a
primary sense marked this way, with subsequent jargon meanings explained
in terms of it.</p>
<p>We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of
terms. The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon, for several reasons. For one thing, it is well known that many
hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times, even
among the more obscure and intricate neologisms. It often seems that the
generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have an
internal logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism across
separate cultures and even in different languages! For another, the
networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly that ‘first use’ is
often impossible to pin down. And, finally, compendia like this one
alter what they observe by implicitly stamping cultural approval on
terms and widening their use.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related oral
history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest quite a
number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due, and
illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as
<a class="reference external" href="K/kluge.html">*kluge*</a>, <a class="reference external" href="C/cruft.html">*cruft*</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="F/foo.html">*foo*</a>. We believe specialist lexicographers will find
many of the historical notes more than casually instructive.</p>
