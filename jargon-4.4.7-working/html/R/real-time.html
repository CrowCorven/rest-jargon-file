**real time**

1. [techspeak] adj. Describes an application which requires a program to
respond to stimuli within some small upper limit of response time
(typically milli- or microseconds). Process control at a chemical plant
is the `*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ example. Such applications
often require special operating systems (because everything else must
take a back seat to response time) and speed-tuned hardware.

2. adv. In jargon, refers to doing something while people are watching
or waiting. “I asked her how to find the calling procedure's program
counter on the stack and she came up with an algorithm in real time.”
