**rude**: adj.

1. (of a program) Badly written.

2. Functionally poor, e.g., a program that is very difficult to use
because of gratuitously poor (random?) design decisions. Oppose
`*cuspy* <../C/cuspy.html>`__.

3. Anything that manipulates a shared resource without regard for its
other users in such a way as to cause a (non-fatal) problem. Examples:
programs that change tty modes without resetting them on exit, or
windowing programs that keep forcing themselves to the top of the window
stack.
