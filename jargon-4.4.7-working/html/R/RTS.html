**RTS**: /R·T·S/, imp.

Abbreviation for ‘Read The Screen’. Mainly used by hackers in the
microcomputer world. Refers to what one would like to tell the
`*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__ one is forced to explain an extremely simple
application to. Particularly appropriate when the suit failed to notice
the ‘Press any key to continue’ prompt, and wishes to know ‘why won't it
do anything’. Also seen as ‘RTFS’ in especially deserving cases.
