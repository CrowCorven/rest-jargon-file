**religion of CHI**: /ki:/, n.

[Case Western Reserve University] Yet another hackish parody religion
(see also `*Church of the
SubGenius* <../C/Church-of-the-SubGenius.html>`__,
`*Discordianism* <../D/Discordianism.html>`__). In the mid-70s, the
canonical “Introduction to Programming” courses at CWRU were taught in
Algol, and student exercises were punched on cards and run on a Univac
1108 system using a homebrew operating system named CHI. The religion
had no doctrines and but one ritual: whenever the worshiper noted that a
digital clock read 11:08, he or she would recite the phrase “It is
11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN, ARCCOS, ARCTAN.” The last five words
were the first five functions in the appropriate chapter of the Algol
manual; note the special pronunciations /obz/ and /ark´sin/ rather than
the more common /ahbz/ and /ark´si:n/. Using an alarm clock to warn of
11:08's arrival was `*considered
harmful* <../C/considered-harmful.html>`__.
