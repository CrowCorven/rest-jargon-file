**rat dance**: n.

[From the `*Dilbert* <../D/Dilbert.html>`__ comic strip of November 14,
1995] A `*hacking run* <../H/hacking-run.html>`__ that produces results
which, while superficially coherent, have little or nothing to do with
its original objectives. There are strong connotations that the coding
process and the objectives themselves were pretty
`*random* <random.html>`__. (In the original comic strip, the Ratbert is
invited to dance on Dilbert's keyboard in order to produce bugs for him
to fix, and authors a Web browser instead.) Compare `*Infinite-Monkey
Theorem* <../I/Infinite-Monkey-Theorem.html>`__.

This term seems to have become widely recognized quite rapidly after the
original strip, a fact which testifies to Dilbert's huge popularity
among hackers. All too many find the perverse incentives and Kafkaesque
atmosphere of Dilbert's mythical workplace reflective of their own
experiences.
