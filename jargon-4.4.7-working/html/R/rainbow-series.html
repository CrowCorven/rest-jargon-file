**rainbow series**: n.

Any of several series of technical manuals distinguished by cover color.
The original rainbow series was the NCSC security manuals (see `*Orange
Book* <../O/Orange-Book.html>`__). These are now available `via the
web <http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/>`__. the term has
also been commonly applied to the PostScript reference set. Which books
are meant by “\ *the* rainbow series” unqualified is thus dependent on
one's local technical culture.
