**ravs**: /ravz/, Chinese ravs, n.

[primarily MIT/Boston usage] Jiao-zi (steamed or boiled) or Guo-tie
(pan-fried). A Chinese appetizer, known variously in the plural as
dumplings, pot stickers (the literal translation of guo-tie), and
(around Boston) ‘Peking Ravioli’. The term rav is short for ‘ravioli’,
and among hackers always means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian
kind. Both consist of a filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind
includes no cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling
(good ones include Chinese chives), and is cooked differently, either by
steaming or frying. A rav or dumpling can be cooked any way, but a
potsticker is always the pan-fried kind (so called because it sticks to
the frying pot and has to be scraped off). “Let's get hot-and-sour soup
and three orders of ravs.” See also `*oriental
food* <../O/oriental-food.html>`__.
