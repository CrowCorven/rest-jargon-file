**RTM**: /R·T·M/

1. [Usenet: abbreviation for ‘Read The Manual’] Politer variant of
`*RTFM* <RTFM.html>`__.

2. Robert Tappan Morris, perpetrator of the great Internet worm of 1988
(see `*Great Worm* <../G/Great-Worm.html>`__); villain to many, naive
hacker gone wrong to a few. Morris claimed that the worm that brought
the Internet to its knees was a benign experiment that got out of
control as the result of a coding error. After the storm of negative
publicity that followed this blunder, Morris's username on ITS was
hacked from RTM to `*RTFM* <RTFM.html>`__.
