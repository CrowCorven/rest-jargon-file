**rain dance**: n.

1. Any ceremonial action taken to correct a hardware problem, with the
expectation that nothing will be accomplished. This especially applies
to reseating printed circuit boards, reconnecting cables, etc. “I can't
boot up the machine. We'll have to wait for Greg to do his rain dance.”

2. Any arcane sequence of actions performed with computers or software
in order to achieve some goal; the term is usually restricted to rituals
that include both an `*incantation* <../I/incantation.html>`__ or two
and physical activity or motion. Compare `*magic* <../M/magic.html>`__,
`*voodoo programming* <../V/voodoo-programming.html>`__, `*black
art* <../B/black-art.html>`__, `*cargo cult
programming* <../C/cargo-cult-programming.html>`__, `*wave a dead
chicken* <../W/wave-a-dead-chicken.html>`__; see also `*casting the
runes* <../C/casting-the-runes.html>`__.
