**religious issues**: n.

Questions which seemingly cannot be raised without touching off `*holy
wars* <../H/holy-wars.html>`__, such as “What is the best operating
system (or editor, language, architecture, shell, mail reader, news
reader)?”, “What about that Heinlein guy, eh?”, “What should we add to
the new Jargon File?” See `*holy wars* <../H/holy-wars.html>`__; see
also `*theology* <../T/theology.html>`__, `*bigot* <../B/bigot.html>`__,
and compare `*rathole* <rathole.html>`__.

This term is a prime example of `*ha ha only
serious* <../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__. People actually develop the
most amazing and religiously intense attachments to their tools, even
when the tools are intangible. The most constructive thing one can do
when one stumbles into the crossfire is mumble `*Get a
life!* <../G/Get-a-life-.html>`__ and leave — unless, of course, one's
*own* unassailably rational and obviously correct choices are being
slammed.
