--------------

**rococo**: adj.

Terminally `*baroque* <../B/baroque.html>`__. Used to imply that a
program has become so encrusted with the software equivalent of gold
leaf and curlicues that they have completely swamped the underlying
design. Called after the later and more extreme forms of Baroque
architecture and decoration prevalent during the mid-1700s in Europe.
Alan Perlis said: “Every program eventually becomes rococo, and then
rubble.” Compare `*critical mass* <../C/critical-mass.html>`__.
