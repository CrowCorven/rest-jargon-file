**RTFM**: /R·T·F·M/, imp.

[Unix] Abbreviation for ‘Read The Fucking Manual’.

1. Used by `*guru* <../G/guru.html>`__\ s to brush off questions they
consider trivial or annoying. Compare `*Don't do that
then!* <../D/Don-t-do-that-then-.html>`__.

2. Used when reporting a problem to indicate that you aren't just asking
out of `*randomness* <randomness.html>`__. “No, I can't figure out how
to interface Unix to my toaster, and yes, I have RTFM.” Unlike sense 1,
this use is considered polite. See also `*FM* <../F/FM.html>`__,
`*RTFAQ* <RTFAQ.html>`__, `*RTFB* <RTFB.html>`__,
`*RTFS* <RTFS.html>`__, `*STFW* <../S/STFW.html>`__,
`*RTM* <RTM.html>`__, all of which mutated from RTFM, and compare
`*UTSL* <../U/UTSL.html>`__.
