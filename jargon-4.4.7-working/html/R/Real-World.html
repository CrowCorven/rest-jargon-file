**Real World**: n.

1. Those institutions at which ‘programming’ may be used in the same
sentence as ‘FORTRAN’, ‘\ `*COBOL* <../C/COBOL.html>`__\ ’, ‘RPG’,
‘\ `*IBM* <../I/IBM.html>`__\ ’, ‘DBASE’, etc. Places where programs do
such commercially necessary but intellectually uninspiring things as
generating payroll checks and invoices.

2. The location of non-programmers and activities not related to
programming.

3. A bizarre dimension in which the standard dress is shirt and tie and
in which a person's working hours are defined as 9 to 5 (see `*code
grinder* <../C/code-grinder.html>`__).

4. Anywhere outside a university. “Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone
into the Real World.” Used pejoratively by those not in residence there.
In conversation, talking of someone who has entered the Real World is
not unlike speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on
the campus of Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted
lamp-post which bears the label ‘REALITY CHECKPOINT’. It marks the
boundary between university and the Real World; check your notions of
reality before passing. This joke is funnier because the Cambridge
‘campus’ is actually coextensive with the center of Cambridge town. See
also `*fear and loathing* <../F/fear-and-loathing.html>`__,
`*mundane* <../M/mundane.html>`__, and
`*uninteresting* <../U/uninteresting.html>`__.
