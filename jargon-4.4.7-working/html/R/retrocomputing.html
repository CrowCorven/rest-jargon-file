**retrocomputing**: /ret'·roh·k@m·pyoo´ting/, n.

Refers to emulations of way-behind-the-state-of-the-art hardware or
software, or implementations of never-was-state-of-the-art; esp. if such
implementations are elaborate practical jokes and/or parodies, written
mostly for `*hack value* <../H/hack-value.html>`__, of more ‘serious’
designs. Perhaps the most widely distributed retrocomputing utility was
the pnch(6) or bcd(6) program on V7 and other early Unix versions, which
would accept up to 80 characters of text argument and display the
corresponding pattern in `*punched card* <../P/punched-card.html>`__
code. Other well-known retrocomputing hacks have included the
programming language `*INTERCAL* <../I/INTERCAL.html>`__, a
`*JCL* <../J/JCL.html>`__-emulating shell for Unix, the
card-punch-emulating editor named 029, and various elaborate
`*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ hardware emulators and RT-11 OS
emulators written just to keep an old, sourceless
`*Zork* <../Z/Zork.html>`__ binary running.

A tasty selection of retrocomputing programs are made available at the
Retrocomputing Museum,
