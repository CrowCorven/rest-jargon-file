**rubber-hose cryptanalysis**: n.

[sci.crypt newsgroup] The technique of breaking a code or cipher by
finding someone who has the key and applying a rubber hose vigorously
and repeatedly to the soles of that luckless person's feet until the key
is discovered. Shorthand for any method of coercion: the originator of
the term drily noted that it “can take a surprisingly short time and is
quite computationally inexpensive” relative to other cryptanalysis
methods. Compare `*social
engineering* <../S/social-engineering.html>`__, `*brute
force* <../B/brute-force.html>`__.
