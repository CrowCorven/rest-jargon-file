**restriction**: n.

A `*bug* <../B/bug.html>`__ or design error that limits a program's
capabilities, and which is sufficiently egregious that nobody can quite
work up enough nerve to describe it as a
`*feature* <../F/feature.html>`__. Often used (esp. by
`*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__ types) to make it sound as
though some crippling bogosity had been intended by the designers all
along, or was forced upon them by arcane technical constraints of a
nature no mere user could possibly comprehend (these claims are almost
invariably false).

Old-time hacker Joseph M. Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a
quantifiable but arbitrary restriction, you should make it either a
power of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1. If you impose a limit of 107 items
in a list, everyone will know it is a random number — on the other hand,
a limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep reason (involving 0- or 1-based
indexing in binary) and you will get less
`*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__ for it. Limits which are round numbers
in base 10 are always especially suspect.
