**recursive acronym**: n.

A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to choose
acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously to themselves or to other
acronyms/abbreviations. The original of the breed may have been TINT
(“TINT Is Not TECO”). The classic examples were two MIT editors called
EINE (“EINE Is Not EMACS”) and ZWEI (“ZWEI Was EINE Initially”). More
recently, there is a Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply
Recursively), and `*GNU* <../G/GNU.html>`__ (q.v., sense 1) stands for
“GNU's Not Unix!” — and a company with the name Cygnus, which expands to
“Cygnus, Your GNU Support” (though Cygnus people say this is a
`*backronym* <../B/backronym.html>`__). The GNU recursive acronym may
have been patterned on XINU, “XINU Is Not Unix” — a particularly nice
example because it is a mirror image, a backronym, and a recursive
acronym. See also `*mung* <../M/mung.html>`__,
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__.
