--------------

**rave**: vi.

[WPI]

1. To persist in discussing a specific subject.

2. To speak authoritatively on a subject about which one knows very
little.

3. To complain to a person who is not in a position to correct the
difficulty.

4. To purposely annoy another person verbally.

5. To evangelize. See `*flame* <../F/flame.html>`__.

6. Also used to describe a less negative form of blather, such as
friendly bullshitting. ‘Rave’ differs slightly from
`*flame* <../F/flame.html>`__ in that rave implies that it is the
persistence or obliviousness of the person speaking that is annoying,
while `*flame* <../F/flame.html>`__ implies somewhat more strongly that
the tone or content is offensive as well.
