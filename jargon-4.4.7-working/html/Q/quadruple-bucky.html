**quadruple bucky**: n. obs.

1. On an MIT `*space-cadet
keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__, use of all four of the
shifting keys (control, meta, hyper, and super) while typing a character
key.

2. On a Stanford or MIT keyboard in `*raw mode* <../R/raw-mode.html>`__,
use of four shift keys while typing a fifth character, where the four
shift keys are the control and meta keys on *both* sides of the
keyboard. This was very difficult to do! One accepted technique was to
press the left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the fifth
key with your nose.

Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in practice, because
when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to some
character that was easier to type. If you want to imply that a program
has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say something like:
“Oh, the command that makes it spin the tapes while whistling
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is quadruple-bucky-cokebottle.” See `*double
bucky* <../D/double-bucky.html>`__, `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__,
`*cokebottle* <../C/cokebottle.html>`__.
