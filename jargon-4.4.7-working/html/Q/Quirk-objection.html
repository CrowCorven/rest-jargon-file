**Quirk objection**: interj.

[Named for Captain Gym Z. Quirk, the first to raise it.] “Objection!
Assumes organ not in evidence!” Used in ``news.admin.net-abuse.email``
to point out that a comment assumes the presence of something whose
existence has not been proven, such as a spammer's brain or gonads. This
is not used to refer to things that are definitely proven *not* to
exist, such as a spammer's ethics. It's applicable to enough postings
there that a poster wishing to raise the objection often need merely say
“ObQuirk!”, an instance of the `*Ob-* <../O/Ob-.html>`__ convention.
