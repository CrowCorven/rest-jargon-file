**YHBT**: //

[Usenet: very common] Abbreviation: You Have Been Trolled (see
`*troll* <../T/troll.html>`__, sense 1). Especially used in “YHBT. YHL.
HAND.”, which is widely understood to expand to “You Have Been Trolled.
You Have Lost. Have A Nice Day”. You are quite likely to see this if you
respond incautiously to a flame-provoking post that was obviously
floated as sucker bait.
