**Zork**: /zork/, n.

The second of the great early experiments in computer fantasy gaming;
see `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__. Originally written on MIT-DM during
1977-1979, later distributed with BSD Unix (as a patched, sourceless
RT-11 FORTRAN binary; see
`*retrocomputing* <../R/retrocomputing.html>`__) and commercialized as
‘The Zork Trilogy’ by `*Infocom* <../I/Infocom.html>`__. The FORTRAN
source was later rewritten for portability and released to Usenet under
the name “Dungeon”. Both FORTRAN “Dungeon” and translated C versions are
available at many FTP sites; the commercial Zork trilogy is available at
`http://www.ifarchive.org/ <http://www.ifarchive.org/>`__. See also
`*grue* <../G/grue.html>`__. You can play Zork via a `Java
Applet <http://www.forkexec.com/html/play-zork1.html>`__.
