**zombie**: n.

1. [Unix] A process that has died but has not yet relinquished its
process table slot (because the parent process hasn't executed a wait(2)
for it yet). These can be seen in ps(1) listings occasionally. Compare
`*orphan* <../O/orphan.html>`__.

2. A machine, especially someone's `*home box* <../H/home-box.html>`__,
that has been cracked and is being used as part of a second-stage attack
by miscreants trying to mask their home IP address. Especially used of
machines being exploited in large gangs for a mechanized
denial-of-service attack like Tribe Flood Network; the image that goes
with this is of a veritable army of zombies mindlessly doing the bidding
of a necromancer.
