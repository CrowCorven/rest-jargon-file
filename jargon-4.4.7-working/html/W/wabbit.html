**wabbit**: /wab´it/, n.

[almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line “You wascawwy
wabbit!”]

1. A legendary early hack reported on a System/360 at RPI and elsewhere
around 1978; this may have descended (if only by inspiration) from a
hack called RABBITS reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the
University of Washington Computer Center. The program would make two
copies of itself every time it was run, eventually crashing the system.

2. By extension, any hack that includes infinite self-replication but is
not a `*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__ or `*worm* <worm.html>`__. See
`*fork bomb* <../F/fork-bomb.html>`__ and `*rabbit
job* <../R/rabbit-job.html>`__, see also `*cookie
monster* <../C/cookie-monster.html>`__.
