**weenie**: n.

1. [on BBSes] Any of a species of luser resembling a less amusing
version of `*B1FF* <../B/B1FF.html>`__ that infests many
`*BBS* <../B/BBS.html>`__ systems. The typical weenie is a teenage boy
with poor social skills travelling under a grandiose
`*handle* <../H/handle.html>`__ derived from fantasy or heavy-metal rock
lyrics. Among sysops, the weenie problem refers to the marginally
literate and profanity-laden `*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__ weenies
tend to spew all over a newly-discovered BBS. Compare
`*spod* <../S/spod.html>`__, `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__, `*terminal
junkie* <../T/terminal-junkie.html>`__, `*warez
d00dz* <warez-d00dz.html>`__.

2. [among hackers] When used with a qualifier (for example, as in `*Unix
weenie* <../U/Unix-weenie.html>`__, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this can be
either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context, tone of
voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers him or
herself to be the same sort of weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a
major investment of time, effort, and concentration into the area
indicated; whether this is good or bad depends on the hearer's judgment
of how the speaker feels about that area. See also
`*bigot* <../B/bigot.html>`__.

3. The semicolon character, ``;`` (ASCII 0111011).
