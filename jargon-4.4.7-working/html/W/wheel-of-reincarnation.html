**wheel of reincarnation**

[coined in a paper by T.H. Myer and I.E. Sutherland *On the Design of
Display Processors*, Comm. ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to
refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system
family is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed,
then the peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its
job, then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function back
into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in communications and
floating-point processors. Also known as the Wheel of Life, the Wheel of
Samsara, and other variations of the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological
idea. See also `*blitter* <../B/blitter.html>`__.
