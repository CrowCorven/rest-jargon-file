**WYSIWYG**: /wiz´ee·wig/, /wiss´ee·wig/, adj.

[Traced to Flip Wilson's “Geraldine” character c.1970] Describes a user
interface under which “What You See Is What You Get”, as opposed to one
that uses more-or-less obscure commands that do not result in immediate
visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple fonts
or graphics is a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants of this term
to express real-world manifestations including WYSIAWYG (What You See Is
*Almost* What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What
You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to
refer to dumbed-down `*user-friendly* <../U/user-friendly.html>`__
interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure
commands (compare `*WYSIAYG* <WYSIAYG.html>`__). On the other hand,
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__ was one of the very first WYSIWYG editors,
replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely obscure,
command-based `*TECO* <../T/TECO.html>`__. See also `*WIMP
environment* <WIMP-environment.html>`__. [Oddly enough, WYSIWYG made it
into the 1986 supplement to the OED, in lower case yet. —ESR]
