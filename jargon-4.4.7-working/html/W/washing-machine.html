**washing machine**: n.

1. Old-style 14-inch hard disks in floor-standing cabinets. So called
because of the size of the cabinet and the ‘top-loading’ access to the
media packs — and, of course, they were always set on ‘spin cycle’. The
washing-machine idiom transcends language barriers; it is even used in
Russian hacker jargon. See also `*walking
drives* <walking-drives.html>`__. The thick channel cables connecting
these were called bit hoses (see `*hose* <../H/hose.html>`__, sense 3).

2. [CMU] A machine used exclusively for `*washing
software* <washing-software.html>`__. CMU has clusters of these.
