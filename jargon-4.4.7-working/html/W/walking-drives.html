**walking drives**: n.

An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in the days when
they were huge, clunky `*washing machine* <washing-machine.html>`__\ s.
Those old `*dinosaur* <../D/dinosaur.html>`__ parts carried terrific
angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn
bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to
‘walk’ across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of
millimeters at a time. There is a legend about a drive that walked over
to the only door to the computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had
to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at it! Walking could also be
induced by certain patterns of drive access (a fast seek across the
whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek in the other
direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how to induce
disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive models
and held disk-drive races.
