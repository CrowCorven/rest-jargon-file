**well-behaved**: adj.

1. Software that does its job quietly and without counterintuitive
effects. Esp.: said of software having an interface spec sufficiently
simple and well-defined that it can be used as a
`*tool* <../T/tool.html>`__ by other software. See
`*cat* <../C/cat.html>`__.

2. Said of an algorithm that doesn't `*crash* <../C/crash.html>`__ or
`*blow up* <../B/blow-up.html>`__, even when given
`*pathological* <../P/pathological.html>`__ input. Implies that the
stability of the algorithm is intrinsic, which makes this somewhat
different from `*bulletproof* <../B/bulletproof.html>`__.
