**worm**: n.

[from tapeworm in John Brunner's novel *The Shockwave Rider*, via XEROX
PARC] A program that propagates itself over a network, reproducing
itself as it goes. Compare `*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__. Nowadays the
term has negative connotations, as it is assumed that only
`*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__\ s write worms. Perhaps the best-known
example was Robert T. Morris's `*Great Worm* <../G/Great-Worm.html>`__
of 1988, a ‘benign’ one that got out of control and hogged hundreds of
Suns and VAXen across the U.S. See also
`*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__, `*RTM* <../R/RTM.html>`__, `*Trojan
horse* <../T/Trojan-horse.html>`__, `*ice* <../I/ice.html>`__.
