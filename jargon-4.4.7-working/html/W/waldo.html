**waldo**: /wol´doh/, n.

[From Robert A. Heinlein's story *Waldo*]

1. A mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm, controlled by a human
limb. When these were developed for the nuclear industry in the
mid-1940s they were named after the invention described by Heinlein in
the story, which he wrote in 1942. Now known by the more generic term
telefactoring, this technology is of intense interest to NASA for tasks
like space station maintenance.

2. At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham and students), this is used
instead of `*foobar* <../F/foobar.html>`__ as a metasyntactic variable
and general nonsense word. See `*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__,
`*bar* <../B/bar.html>`__, `*foobar* <../F/foobar.html>`__,
`*quux* <../Q/quux.html>`__.
