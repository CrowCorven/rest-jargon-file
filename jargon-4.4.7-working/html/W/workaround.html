**workaround**: n.

1. A temporary `*kluge* <../K/kluge.html>`__ used to bypass, mask, or
otherwise avoid a `*bug* <../B/bug.html>`__ or
`*misfeature* <../M/misfeature.html>`__ in some system. Theoretically,
workarounds are always replaced by `*fix* <../F/fix.html>`__\ es; in
practice, customers often find themselves living with workarounds for
long periods of time. “The code died on NUL characters in the input, so
I fixed it to interpret them as spaces.” “That's not a fix, that's a
workaround!”

2. A procedure to be employed by the user in order to do what some
currently non-working feature should do. Hypothetical example: “Using
META-F7 `*crash* <../C/crash.html>`__\ es the 4.43 build of Weemax, but
as a workaround you can type CTRL-R, then SHIFT-F5, and delete the
remaining `*cruft* <../C/cruft.html>`__ by hand.”
