**whack-a-mole**: n.

[from the carnival game which involves quickly and repeatedly hitting
the heads of mechanical moles with a mallet as they pop up from their
holes.]

1. The practice of repeatedly causing spammers' `*throwaway
account* <../T/throwaway-account.html>`__\ s and drop boxes to be
terminated.

2. After sense 1 became established in the mid-1990s the term passed
into more generalized use, and now is commonly found in such
combinations as whack-a-mole windows; the obnoxious pop-up advertisement
windows spawned in flocks when you surf to sites like Angelfire or
Lycos.
