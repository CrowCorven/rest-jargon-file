**win**

[MIT; now common everywhere]

1. vi. To succeed. A program wins if no unexpected conditions arise, or
(especially) if it is sufficiently `*robust* <../R/robust.html>`__ to
take exceptions in stride.

2. n. Success, or a specific instance thereof. A pleasing outcome. “So
it turned out I could use a `*lexer* <../L/lexer.html>`__ generator
instead of hand-coding my own pattern recognizer. What a win!” Emphatic
forms: moby win, super win, hyper-win (often used interjectively as a
reply). For some reason suitable win is also common at MIT, usually in
reference to a satisfactory solution to a problem. Oppose
`*lose* <../L/lose.html>`__; see also `*big win* <../B/big-win.html>`__,
which isn't quite just an intensification of win.
