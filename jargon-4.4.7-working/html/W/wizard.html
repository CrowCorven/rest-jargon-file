**wizard**: n.

1. Transitively, a person who knows how a complex piece of software or
hardware works (that is, who `*grok* <../G/grok.html>`__\ s it); esp.
someone who can find and fix bugs quickly in an emergency. Someone is a
`*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__ if he or she has general hacking
ability, but is a wizard with respect to something only if he or she has
specific detailed knowledge of that thing. A good hacker could become a
wizard for something given the time to study it.

2. The term ‘wizard’ is also used intransitively of someone who has
extremely high-level hacking or problem-solving ability.

3. A person who is permitted to do things forbidden to ordinary people;
one who has `*wheel* <wheel.html>`__ privileges on a system.

4. A Unix expert, esp. a Unix systems programmer. This usage is well
enough established that ‘Unix Wizard’ is a recognized job title at some
corporations and to most headhunters.
