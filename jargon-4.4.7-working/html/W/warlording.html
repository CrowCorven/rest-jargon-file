**warlording**: v.

[from the Usenet group ``alt.fan.warlord``] The act of excoriating a
bloated, ugly, or derivative `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__.
Common grounds for warlording include the presence of a signature
rendered in a `*BUAF* <../B/BUAF.html>`__, over-used or cliched `*sig
quote* <../S/sig-quote.html>`__\ s, ugly `*ASCII
art* <../A/ASCII-art.html>`__, or simply excessive size. The original
‘Warlord’ was a `*B1FF* <../B/B1FF.html>`__-like
`*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__ c.1991 who featured in his sig a
particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the sword of
Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie; the group name
``alt.fan.warlord`` was sarcasm, and the characteristic mode of
warlording is devastatingly sarcastic praise. See also `*McQuary
limit* <../M/McQuary-limit.html>`__.
