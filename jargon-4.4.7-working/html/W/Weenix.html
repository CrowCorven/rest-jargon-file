**Weenix**: /wee´niks/, n.

1. [ITS] A derogatory term for `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__, derived from
`*Unix weenie* <../U/Unix-weenie.html>`__. According to one noted
ex-ITSer, it is “the operating system preferred by Unix Weenies:
typified by poor modularity, poor reliability, hard file deletion, no
file version numbers, case sensitivity everywhere, and users who believe
that these are all advantages”. (Some ITS fans behave as though they
believe Unix stole a future that rightfully belonged to them. See
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__, sense 2.)

2. [Brown University] A Unix-like OS developed for tutorial purposes at
Brown University. See
`http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/weenix.html <http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/weenix.html>`__.
Named independently of the ITS usage.
