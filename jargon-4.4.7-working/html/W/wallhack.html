**wallhack**

A form of game cheat especially associated with first-person shooters
like Quake, in which the walls in the simulated maze or dungeon are
rendered transparent to the cheater. This gives the cheater normally
hidden information about the whereabouts of other players. Beyond
gaming, a wallhack is the paradigm case of a whole class of security
problems that stem from the fact that a server cannot trust client
software, and server authors must assume that all computation farmed out
to a client is exposed to and can be interfered with by the user.
