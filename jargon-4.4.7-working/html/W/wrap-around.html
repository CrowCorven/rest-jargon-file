**wrap around**: vi.

(also n. wraparound and v. shorthand wrap)

1. [techspeak] The action of a counter that starts over at zero or at
minus infinity (see `*infinity* <../I/infinity.html>`__) after its
maximum value has been reached, and continues incrementing, either
because it is programmed to do so or because of an overflow (as when a
car's odometer starts over at 0).

2. To change `*phase* <../P/phase.html>`__ gradually and continuously by
maintaining a steady wake-sleep cycle somewhat longer than 24 hours,
e.g., living six long (28-hour) days in a week (or, equivalently,
sleeping at the rate of 10 microhertz). This sense is also called
`*phase-wrapping* <../P/phase-wrapping.html>`__.
