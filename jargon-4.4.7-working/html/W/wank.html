**wank**: /wangk/, n.,v.,adj.

[Columbia University: prob.: by mutation from Commonwealth slang v.
wank, to masturbate] Used much as `*hack* <../H/hack.html>`__ is
elsewhere, as a noun denoting a clever technique or person or the result
of such cleverness. May describe (negatively) the act of hacking for
hacking's sake (“Quit wanking, let's go get supper!”) or (more
positively) a `*wizard* <wizard.html>`__. Adj. wanky describes something
particularly clever (a person, program, or algorithm). Conversations can
also get wanky when there are too many wanks involved. This excess
wankiness is signalled by an overload of the wankometer (compare
`*bogometer* <../B/bogometer.html>`__). When the wankometer overloads,
the conversation's subject must be changed, or all non-wanks will leave.
Compare neep-neeping (under `*neep-neep* <../N/neep-neep.html>`__).
Usage: U.S. only. In Britain and the Commonwealth this word is
*extremely* rude and is best avoided unless one intends to give offense.
Adjectival wanky is less offensive and simply means ‘stupid’ or ‘broken’
(this is mainstream in Great Britain).
