**WOMBAT**: /wom´bat/, adj.

[acronym: Waste Of Money, Brains, And Time] Applied to problems which
are both profoundly `*uninteresting* <../U/uninteresting.html>`__ in
themselves and unlikely to benefit anyone interesting even if solved.
Often used in fanciful constructions such as wrestling with a wombat.
See also `*crawling horror* <../C/crawling-horror.html>`__,
`*SMOP* <../S/SMOP.html>`__. Also note the rather different usage as a
metasyntactic variable in `*Commonwealth
Hackish* <../C/Commonwealth-Hackish.html>`__.

Users of the `*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ database program DATATRIEVE
adopted the wombat as their notional mascot; the program's help file
responded to “HELP WOMBAT” with factual information about Real World
wombats.
