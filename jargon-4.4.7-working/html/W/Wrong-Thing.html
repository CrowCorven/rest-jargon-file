**Wrong Thing**: n.

A design, action, or decision that is clearly incorrect or
inappropriate. Often capitalized; always emphasized in speech as if
capitalized. The opposite of the `*Right
Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__; more generally, anything that is not
the Right Thing. In cases where ‘the good is the enemy of the best’, the
merely good — although good — is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. “In C,
the default is for module-level declarations to be visible everywhere,
rather than just within the module. This is clearly the Wrong Thing.”
