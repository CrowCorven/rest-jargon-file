**working as designed**: adj.

[IBM]

1. In conformance to a wrong or inappropriate specification; useful, but
misdesigned.

2. Frequently used as a sardonic comment on a program's utility.

3. Unfortunately also used as a bogus reason for not accepting a
criticism or suggestion. At `*IBM* <../I/IBM.html>`__, this sense is
used in official documents! See `*BAD* <../B/BAD.html>`__.
