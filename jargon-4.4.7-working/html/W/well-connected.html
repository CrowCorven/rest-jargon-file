**well-connected**: adj.

Said of a computer installation, asserts that it has reliable email
links with the network and/or that it relays a large fraction of
available `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ newsgroups. Well-known can be
almost synonymous, but also implies that the site's name is familiar to
many (due perhaps to an archive service or active Usenet users).
