**I for one welcome our new X overlords**

Variants of this phrase with various values of X came into common use in
2002-2003, generally used to suggest that whatever party referred to as
the new overlords is deeply evil. In the original *Simpsons* episode
`(#96, *Homer In
Space*) <http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-146/epid-1381/>`__
X = “insect” and th line is part of a speech in which a smarmy
newscaster expresses his willingness to collaborate with an invading
race of giant space ants.
