**I see no X here.**

Hackers (and the interactive computer games they write) traditionally
favor this slightly marked usage over other possible equivalents such as
“There's no X here!” or “X is missing.” or “Where's the X?”. This goes
back to the original PDP-10 `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__, which would
respond in this wise if you asked it to do something involving an object
not present at your location in the game.
