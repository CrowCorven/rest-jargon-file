**IRC**: /I·R·C/, n.

[Internet Relay Chat] A worldwide “party line” network that allows one
to converse with others in real time. IRC is structured as a network of
Internet servers, each of which accepts connections from client
programs, one per user. The IRC community and the
`*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ and `*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__
communities overlap to some extent, including both hackers and regular
folks who have discovered the wonders of computer networks. Some Usenet
jargon has been adopted on IRC, as have some conventions such as
`*emoticon* <../E/emoticon.html>`__\ s. There is also a vigorous native
jargon, represented in this lexicon by entries marked ‘[IRC]’. See also
`*talk mode* <../T/talk-mode.html>`__.
