**languages of choice**: n.

`*C* <../C/C.html>`__, `*Perl* <../P/Perl.html>`__,
`*Python* <../P/Python.html>`__, `*Java* <../J/Java.html>`__ and
`*LISP* <LISP.html>`__ — the dominant languages in open-source
development. This list has changed over time, but slowly. Java bumped
C++ off of it, and Python appears to be recruiting people who would
otherwise gravitate to LISP (which used to be much more important than
it is now). Smalltalk and Prolog are also popular in small but
influential communities.

The `*Real Programmer* <../R/Real-Programmer.html>`__\ s who loved
FORTRAN and assembler have pretty much all retired or died since 1990.
Assembler is generally no longer considered interesting or appropriate
for anything but `*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__ implementation,
`*glue* <../G/glue.html>`__, and a few time-critical and
hardware-specific uses in systems programs. FORTRAN occupies a shrinking
niche in scientific programming.

Most hackers tend to frown on languages like
`*Pascal* <../P/Pascal.html>`__ and Ada, which don't give them the
near-total freedom considered necessary for hacking (see
`*bondage-and-discipline
language* <../B/bondage-and-discipline-language.html>`__), and to regard
everything even remotely connected with `*COBOL* <../C/COBOL.html>`__ or
other traditional `*DP* <../D/DP.html>`__ languages as a total and
unmitigated `*loss* <loss.html>`__.
