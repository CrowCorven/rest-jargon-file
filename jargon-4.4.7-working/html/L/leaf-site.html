**leaf site**: n.

[obs.] Before pervasive TCP/IP, this term was used of a machine that
merely originated and read Usenet news or mail, and did not relay any
third-party traffic. It was often uttered in a critical tone; when the
ratio of leaf sites to backbone, rib, and other relay sites got too
high, the network tended to develop bottlenecks. Compare `*backbone
site* <../B/backbone-site.html>`__. Now that traffic patterns depend
more on the distribution of routers than of host machines this term has
largely fallen out of use.
