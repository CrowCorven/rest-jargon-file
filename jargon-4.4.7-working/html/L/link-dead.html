**link-dead**: adj.

[MUD] The state a player is in when they kill their connection to a
`*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__ without leaving it properly. The player is
then commonly left as a statue in the game, and is only removed after a
certain period of time (an hour on most MUDs). Used on
`*IRC* <../I/IRC.html>`__ as well, although it is inappropriate in that
context. Compare `*netdead* <../N/netdead.html>`__.
