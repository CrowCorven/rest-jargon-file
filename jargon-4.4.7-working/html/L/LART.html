**LART**: //

Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool.

1. n. In the collective mythos of `*scary devil
monastery* <../S/scary-devil-monastery.html>`__, this is an essential
item in the toolkit of every `*BOFH* <../B/BOFH.html>`__. The LART
classic is a 2x4 or other large billet of wood usable as a club, to be
applied upside the head of spammers and other people who cause sysadmins
more grief than just naturally goes with the job. Perennial debates rage
on ``alt.sysadmin.recovery`` over what constitutes the truly effective
LART; knobkerries, automatic weapons, flamethrowers, and tactical nukes
all have their partisans. Compare
`*clue-by-four* <../C/clue-by-four.html>`__.

2. v. To use a LART. Some would add “in malice”, but some sysadmins do
prefer to gently lart their users as a first (and sometimes final)
warning.

3. interj. Calling for one's LART, much as a surgeon might call
“Scalpel!”.

4. interj. [rare] Used in `*flame* <../F/flame.html>`__\ s as a rebuke.
“LART! LART! LART!”
