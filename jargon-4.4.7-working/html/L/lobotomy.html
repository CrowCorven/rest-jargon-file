**lobotomy**: n.

1. What a hacker subjected to formal management training is said to have
undergone. At IBM and elsewhere this term is used by both hackers and
low-level management; the latter doubtless intend it as a joke.

2. The act of removing the processor from a microcomputer in order to
replace or upgrade it. Some very cheap `*clone* <../C/clone.html>`__
systems are sold in lobotomized form — everything but the brain.
