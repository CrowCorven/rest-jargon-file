**language lawyer**: n.

A person, usually an experienced or senior software engineer, who is
intimately familiar with many or most of the numerous restrictions and
features (both useful and esoteric) applicable to one or more computer
programming languages. A language lawyer is distinguished by the ability
to show you the five sentences scattered through a 200-plus-page manual
that together imply the answer to your question “if only you had thought
to look there”. Compare `*wizard* <../W/wizard.html>`__,
`*legal* <legal.html>`__, `*legalese* <legalese.html>`__.
