**leech**

1. n. (Also leecher.) Among BBS types, crackers and `*warez
d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__, one who consumes knowledge without
generating new software, cracks, or techniques. BBS culture specifically
defines a leech as someone who downloads files with few or no uploads in
return, and who does not contribute to the message section. Cracker
culture extends this definition to someone (a `*lamer* <lamer.html>`__,
usually) who constantly presses informed sources for information and/or
assistance, but has nothing to contribute. See
`*troughie* <../T/troughie.html>`__.

2. v. [common, Toronto area] v. To download a file across any kind of
internet link. “Hop on IRC later so I can leech some MP3s from you.”
Used to describe activities ranging from FTP, to IRC DCC-send, to ICQ
file requests, to Napster searches (but never to downloading email with
file attachments; the implication is that the download is the result of
a browse or search of some sort of file server). Seems to be a holdover
from the early 1990s when Toronto had a very active BBS and warez scene.
Synonymous with `*snarf* <../S/snarf.html>`__ (sense 2), and contrast
`*snarf* <../S/snarf.html>`__ (sense 4).
