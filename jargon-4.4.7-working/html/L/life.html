**life**: n.

1. A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton Conway and first
introduced publicly by Martin Gardner (*Scientific American*, October
1970); the game's popularity had to wait a few years for computers on
which it could reasonably be played, as it's no fun to simulate the
cells by hand. Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it,
and hackers at various places contributed heavily to the mathematical
analysis of this game (most notably Bill Gosper at MIT, who even
implemented life in `*TECO* <../T/TECO.html>`__!). When a hacker
mentions ‘life’, he is much more likely to mean this game than the
magazine, the breakfast cereal, or the human state of existence. Many
web resources are available starting from the `Open Directory page of
Life <http://dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/>`__.
The `Life Lexicon <http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm>`__
is a good indicator of what makes the game so fascinating.
