**lenna**

The Internet's first poster girl, a standard test load used in the image
processing community. The image was originally cropped from the November
1972 issue of *Playboy Magazine*, which anglicized the model's name with
a double n. It has interesting properties — complex feathers, shadows,
smooth (but not flat) surfaces — that are pertinent in demonstrating
various processing algorithms for image compression, filtering,
dithering, texture mapping, image recognition, and so on. After a
quarter century of remaining completely unaware that she had become an
icon, a gray-haired but still winsome Lenna finally met her fans at a
computer graphics conference in 1997. There is a fan page at
`www.lenna.org <http://www.lenna.org>`__, with more details. Compare
`*Utah teapot* <../U/Utah-teapot.html>`__ and `*Stanford
Bunny* <../S/Stanford-Bunny.html>`__
