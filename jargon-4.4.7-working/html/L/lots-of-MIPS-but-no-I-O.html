**lots of MIPS but no I/O**: adj.

Used to describe a person who is technically brilliant but can't seem to
communicate with human beings effectively. Technically it describes a
machine that has lots of processing power but is bottlenecked on
input-output (in 1991, the IBM Rios, a.k.a. RS/6000, was a notorious
example).
