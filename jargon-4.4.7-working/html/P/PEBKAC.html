**PEBKAC**: /peb´kak/

[Abbrev., “Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair”] Used by support
people, particularly at call centers and help desks. Not used with the
public. Denotes pilot error as the cause of the crash, especially stupid
errors that even a `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__ could figure out. Very
derogatory. Usage: “Did you ever figure out why that guy couldn't
print?” “Yeah, he kept cancelling the operation before it could finish.
PEBKAC”. See also `*ID10T* <../I/idiot.html>`__. Compare `*pilot
error* <pilot-error.html>`__, `*UBD* <../U/UBD.html>`__.
