**paper-net**: n.

Hackish way of referring to the postal service, analogizing it to a very
slow, low-reliability network. Usenet `*sig
block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__\ s sometimes include a “Paper-Net:”
header just before the sender's postal address; common variants of this
are “Papernet” and “P-Net”. Note that the standard
`*netiquette* <../N/netiquette.html>`__ guidelines discourage this
practice as a waste of bandwidth, since netters are quite unlikely to
casually use postal addresses. Compare
`*voice-net* <../V/voice-net.html>`__,
`*snail-mail* <../S/snail-mail.html>`__.
