**peek**: n.,vt.

(and `*poke* <poke.html>`__) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs
for directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often
extended to mean the corresponding constructs in any
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__ (peek reads memory, poke modifies it). Much
hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of peeking around
memory, more or less at random, to find the location where the system
keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably accurate) lists of such
addresses for various computers circulated. The results of pokes at
these addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing, useless but neat,
or (most likely) total `*lossage* <../L/lossage.html>`__ (see `*killer
poke* <../K/killer-poke.html>`__).

Since a `*real operating system* <../R/real-operating-system.html>`__
provides useful, higher-level services for the tasks commonly performed
with peeks and pokes on micros, and real languages tend not to encourage
low-level memory groveling, a question like “How do I do a peek in C?”
is diagnostic of the `*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__. (Of course, OS
kernels often have to do exactly this; a real kernel hacker would
unhesitatingly, if unportably, assign an absolute address to a pointer
variable and indirect through it.)
