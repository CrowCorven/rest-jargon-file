**postcardware**: n.

A kind of `*shareware* <../S/shareware.html>`__ that borders on
`*freeware* <../F/freeware.html>`__, in that the author requests only
that satisfied users send a postcard of their home town or something.
(This practice, silly as it might seem, serves to remind users that they
are otherwise getting something for nothing, and may also be
psychologically related to real estate ‘sales’ in which $1 changes hands
just to keep the transaction from being a gift.)
