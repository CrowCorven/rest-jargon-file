**P.O.D.**: /P·O·D/

[rare; sometimes ‘POD’ without the periods] Acronym for ‘Piece Of Data’
or ‘Plain Old Data’ (as opposed to a code section, or a section
containing mixed code and data). The latter expansion was in use by the
C++ standards committee, for which it indicated a struct or class which
only contains data (as in C), distinguished from one which has a
constructor and member functions. There are things which you can do with
a P.O.D. which you can't with a more general class.
