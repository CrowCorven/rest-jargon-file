**profile**: n.

1. A control file for a program, esp. a text file automatically read
from each user's home directory and intended to be easily modified by
the user in order to customize the program's behavior. Used to avoid
`*hardcoded* <../H/hardcoded.html>`__ choices (see also `*dot
file* <../D/dot-file.html>`__, `*rc file* <../R/rc-file.html>`__).

2. [techspeak] A report on the amounts of time spent in each routine of
a program, used to find and `*tune* <../T/tune.html>`__ away the `*hot
spot* <../H/hot-spot.html>`__\ s in it. This sense is often verbed. Some
profiling modes report units other than time (such as call counts)
and/or report at granularities other than per-routine, but the idea is
similar. 3.[techspeak] A subset of a standard used for a particular
purpose. This sense confuses hackers who wander into the weird world of
ISO standards no end!
