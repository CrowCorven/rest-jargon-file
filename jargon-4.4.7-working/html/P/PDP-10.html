**PDP-10**: n.

[Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine that made
`*timesharing* <../T/timesharing.html>`__ real. It looms large in hacker
folklore because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university
computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab,
Stanford, and CMU. Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the
bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed. The 10 was
eventually eclipsed by the `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ machines
(descendants of the `*PDP-11* <PDP-11.html>`__) when
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ recognized that the 10 and
`*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ product lines were competing with each other
and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more
profitable `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__. The machine was finally dropped
from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at
DEC to build a viable new model. (Some attempts by other companies to
market clones came to nothing; see `*Foonly* <../F/Foonly.html>`__ and
`*Mars* <../M/Mars.html>`__.) This event spelled the doom of
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ and the technical cultures that had spawned
the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of a
badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth
on a PDP-10. See `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__,
