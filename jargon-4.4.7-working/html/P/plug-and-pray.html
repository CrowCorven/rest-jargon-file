**plug-and-pray**: adj.,vi.

Parody of the techspeak term plug-and-play, describing a PC peripheral
card which is claimed to have no need for hardware configuration via
jumpers or DIP switches, and which should work as soon as it is inserted
in the PC. Unfortunately, even the PCI bus is all too often not up to
pulling this off reliably, and people who have to do installation or
troubleshoot PCs soon find themselves longing for the jumpers and
switches.
