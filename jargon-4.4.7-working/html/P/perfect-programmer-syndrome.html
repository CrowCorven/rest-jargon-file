**perfect programmer syndrome**: n.

Arrogance; the egotistical conviction that one is above normal human
error. Most frequently found among programmers of some native ability
but relatively little experience (especially new graduates; their
perceptions may be distorted by a history of excellent performance at
solving `*toy problem* <../T/toy-problem.html>`__\ s). “Of course my
program is correct, there is no need to test it.” “Yes, I can see there
may be a problem here, but *I'll* never type **rm -r /** while in `*root
mode* <../R/root-mode.html>`__.”
