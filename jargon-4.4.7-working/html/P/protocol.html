**protocol**: n.

As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the proper form
for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which one
should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't
care about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules
that allow different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with
each other without ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties
about the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the order
in which one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It
implies that there is some common message format and an accepted set of
primitives or commands that all parties involved understand, and that
transactions among them follow predictable logical sequences. See also

protocol* <../D/do-protocol.html>`__.
