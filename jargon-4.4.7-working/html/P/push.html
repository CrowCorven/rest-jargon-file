**push**

[from the operation that puts the current information on a stack, and
the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also
PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push´J/, the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure
call instruction.)

1. To put something onto a `*stack* <../S/stack.html>`__. If one says
that something has been pushed onto one's stack, it means that the
Damoclean list of things hanging over ones's head has grown longer and
heavier yet. This may also imply that one will deal with it *before*
other pending items; otherwise one might say that the thing was ‘added
to my queue’.

2. vi. To enter upon a digression, to save the current discussion for
later. Antonym of `*pop* <pop.html>`__; see also
`*stack* <../S/stack.html>`__.
