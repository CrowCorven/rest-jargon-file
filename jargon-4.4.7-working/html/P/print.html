**print**: v.

To output, even if to a screen. If a hacker says that a program “printed
a message”, he means this; if he refers to printing a file, he probably
means it in the conventional sense of writing to a hardcopy device
(compounds like ‘print job’ and ‘printout’, on the other hand, always
refer to the latter). This very common term is likely a holdover from
the days when printing terminals were the norm, perpetuated by
programming language constructs like `*C* <../C/C.html>`__'s printf(3).
See senses 1 and 2 of `*tty* <../T/tty.html>`__.
