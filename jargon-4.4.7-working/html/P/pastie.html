**pastie**: /pay´stee/, n.

An adhesive-backed label designed to be attached to a key on a keyboard
to indicate some non-standard character which can be accessed through
that key. Pasties are likely to be used in APL environments, where
almost every key is associated with a special character. A pastie on the
R key, for example, might remind the user that it is used to generate
the ρ character. The term properly refers to nipple-concealing devices
formerly worn by strippers in concession to indecent-exposure laws;
compare `*tits on a keyboard* <../T/tits-on-a-keyboard.html>`__.
