**Perl**: /perl/, n.

[Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a. Pathologically
Eclectic Rubbish Lister] An interpreted language developed by Larry
Wall, author of patch(1) and rn(1)). Superficially resembles
`*awk* <../A/awk.html>`__, but is much hairier, including many
facilities reminiscent of sed(1) and shells and a comprehensive Unix
system-call interface. Unix sysadmins, who are almost always
incorrigible hackers, generally consider it one of the `*languages of
choice* <../L/languages-of-choice.html>`__, and it is by far the most
widely used tool for making ‘live’ web pages via CGI. Perl has been
described, in a parody of a famous remark about lex(1), as the
`*Swiss-Army chainsaw* <../S/Swiss-Army-chainsaw.html>`__ of Unix
programming. Though Perl is very useful, it would be a stretch to
describe it as pretty or `*elegant* <../E/elegant.html>`__; people who
like clean, spare design generally prefer `*Python* <Python.html>`__.
See also `*Camel Book* <../C/Camel-Book.html>`__,
`*TMTOWTDI* <../T/TMTOWTDI.html>`__.
