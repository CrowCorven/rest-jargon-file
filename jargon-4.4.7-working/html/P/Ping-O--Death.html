**Ping O' Death**: n.

A notorious `*exploit* <../E/exploit.html>`__ that (when first
discovered) could be easily used to crash a wide variety of machines by
overrunning size limits in their TCP/IP stacks. First revealed in late
1996. The open-source Unix community patched its systems to remove the
vulnerability within days or weeks, the closed-source OS vendors
generally took months. While the difference in response times repeated a
pattern familiar from other security incidents, the accompanying glare
of Web-fueled publicity proved unusually embarrassing to the OS vendors
and so passed into history and myth. The term is now used to refer to
any nudge delivered by network wizards over the network that causes bad
things to happen on the system being nudged. For the full story on the
original exploit, see
`http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html <http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html>`__.

packet.'
