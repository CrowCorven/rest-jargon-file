**plan file**: n.

[Unix] On systems that support `*finger* <../F/finger.html>`__, the
``.plan`` file in a user's home directory is displayed when the user is
fingered. This feature was originally intended to be used to keep
potential fingerers apprised of one's location and near-future plans,
but has been turned almost universally to humorous and self-expressive
purposes (like a `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__). See also
`*Hacking X for Y* <../H/Hacking-X-for-Y.html>`__.

A recent innovation in plan files has been the introduction of
“scrolling plan files” which are one-dimensional animations made using
only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line feed,
avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the
`*finger* <../F/finger.html>`__ command will (for security reasons; see
`*letterbomb* <../L/letterbomb.html>`__) not pass the escape character.

Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some sites
have started competitions to find who can create the longest running,
funniest, and most original animations. Various animation characters
include:

+---------------------------+----------+
| Centipede:                | mmmmme   |
+---------------------------+----------+
| Lorry/Truck:              | oo-oP    |
+---------------------------+----------+
| Andalusian Video Snail:   | \_@/     |
+---------------------------+----------+

and a compiler (ASP) is available on Usenet for producing them. See also
`*twirling baton* <../T/twirling-baton.html>`__.
