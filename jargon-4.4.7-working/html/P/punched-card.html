**punched card**:

[techspeak] (alt.: punch card) The signature medium of computing's
`*Stone Age* <../S/Stone-Age.html>`__, now obsolescent. The punched card
actually predated computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a
control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith
and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was
a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm. There is a widespread myth
that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that era's
larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified this.

IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the
punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of
small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.
Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at
various times.

The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM
punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
with many varieties of computers even today. See
