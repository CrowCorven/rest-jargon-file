padded cell

`Prev <packet-over-air.html>`__ 

P

 `Next <page-in.html>`__

--------------

**padded cell**: n.

Where you put `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__\ s so they can't hurt
anything. A program that limits a luser to a carefully restricted subset
of the capabilities of the host system (for example, the rsh(1) utility
on USG Unix). Note that this is different from an `*iron
box* <../I/iron-box.html>`__ because it is overt and not aimed at
enforcing security so much as protecting others (and the luser) from the
consequences of the luser's boundless naivete (see
`*naive* <../N/naive.html>`__). Also padded cell environment.
