**PDP-20**: n.

The most famous computer that never was. `*PDP-10* <PDP-10.html>`__
computers running the `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__ operating system
were labeled ‘DECsystem-10’ as a way of differentiating them from the
`*PDP-11* <PDP-11.html>`__. Later on, those systems running
`*TOPS-20* <../T/TOPS-20.html>`__ were labeled ‘DECSYSTEM-20’ (the block
capitals being the result of a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer,
which once made a computer called ‘system-10’), but contrary to popular
lore there was never a ‘PDP-20’; the only difference between a 10 and a
20 was the operating system and the color of the paint. Most (but not
all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted ‘Basil Blue’, whereas
most TOPS-20 machines were painted ‘Chinese Red’ (often mistakenly
called orange).
