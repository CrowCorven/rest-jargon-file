**provocative maintenance**: n.

[common ironic mutation of preventive maintenance] Actions performed
upon a machine at regularly scheduled intervals to ensure that the
system remains in a usable state. So called because it is all too often
performed by a `*field servoid* <../F/field-servoid.html>`__ who doesn't
know what he is doing; such ‘maintenance’ often *induces* problems, or
otherwise results in the machine's remaining in an *un*\ usable state
for an indeterminate amount of time. See also `*scratch
monkey* <../S/scratch-monkey.html>`__.
