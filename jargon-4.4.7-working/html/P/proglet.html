**proglet**: /prog´let/, n.

[UK] A short *extempore* program written to meet an immediate, transient
need. Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen lines long, and
containing no subroutines. The largest amount of code that can be
written off the top of one's head, that does not need any editing, and
that runs correctly the first time (this amount varies significantly
according to one's skill and the language one is using). Compare `*toy
program* <../T/toy-program.html>`__, `*noddy* <../N/noddy.html>`__,
`*one-liner wars* <../O/one-liner-wars.html>`__.
