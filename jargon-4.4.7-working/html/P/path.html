**path**: n.

1. A `*bang path* <../B/bang-path.html>`__ or explicitly routed Internet
address; a node-by-node specification of a link between two machines.
Though these are now obsolete as a form of addressing, they still show
up in diagnostics and trace headers occasionally (e.g. in NNTP headers).

2. [Unix] A filename, fully specified relative to the root directory (as
opposed to relative to the current directory; the latter is sometimes
called a relative path). This is also called a pathname.

3. [Unix and MS-DOS/Windows] The search path, an environment variable
specifying the directories in which the `*shell* <../S/shell.html>`__
(COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look for commands. Other, similar
constructs abound under Unix (for example, the C preprocessor has a
search path it uses in looking for **#include** files).
