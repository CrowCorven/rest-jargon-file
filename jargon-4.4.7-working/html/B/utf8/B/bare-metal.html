**bare metal**: n.

1. [common] New computer hardware, unadorned with such snares and
delusions as an `*operating system* <../O/operating-system.html>`__, an
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__, or even assembler. Commonly used in the
phrase programming on the bare metal, which refers to the arduous work
of `*bit bashing* <bit-bashing.html>`__ needed to create these basic
tools for a new machine. Real bare-metal programming involves things
like building boot proms and BIOS chips, implementing basic monitors
used to test device drivers, and writing the assemblers that will be
used to write the compiler back ends that will give the new machine a
real development environment.

2. “Programming on the bare metal” is also used to describe a style of
`*hand-hacking* <../H/hand-hacking.html>`__ that relies on bit-level
peculiarities of a particular hardware design, esp. tricks for speed and
space optimization that rely on crocks such as overlapping instructions
(or, as in the famous case described in `The Story of
Mel' <../story-of-mel.html>`__ (in Appendix A), interleaving of opcodes
on a magnetic drum to minimize fetch delays due to the device's
rotational latency). This sort of thing has become rare as the relative
costs of programming time and machine resources have changed, but is
still found in heavily constrained environments such as industrial
embedded systems. See `*Real Programmer* <../R/Real-Programmer.html>`__.
