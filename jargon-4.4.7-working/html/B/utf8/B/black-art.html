**black art**: n.

[common] A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication)
mostly ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application or
systems area (compare `*black magic* <black-magic.html>`__). VLSI design
and compiler code optimization were (in their beginnings) considered
classic examples of black art; as theory developed they became `*deep
magic* <../D/deep-magic.html>`__, and once standard textbooks had been
written, became merely `*heavy wizardry* <../H/heavy-wizardry.html>`__.
The huge proliferation of formal and informal channels for spreading
around new computer-related technologies during the last twenty years
has made both the term black art and what it describes less common than
formerly. See also `*voodoo
programming* <../V/voodoo-programming.html>`__.
