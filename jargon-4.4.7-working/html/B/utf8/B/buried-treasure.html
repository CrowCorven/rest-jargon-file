**buried treasure**: n.

A surprising piece of code found in some program. While usually not
wrong, it tends to vary from `*crufty* <../C/crufty.html>`__ to
`*bletcherous* <bletcherous.html>`__, and has lain undiscovered only
because it was functionally correct, however horrible it is. Used
sarcastically, because what is found is anything *but* treasure. Buried
treasure almost always needs to be dug up and removed. “I just found
that the scheduler sorts its queue using `*bubble
sort* <bubble-sort.html>`__! Buried treasure!”
