**B1FF**: /bif/, BIFF, n.

The most famous `*pseudo* <../P/pseudo.html>`__, and the prototypical
`*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__. Articles from B1FF feature all
uppercase letters sprinkled liberally with bangs, typos, ‘cute’
misspellings (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD BIFF CUZ KØØL DOOD AN HE RITES
REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN CAPITULL LETTRS LIKE THIS!!!), use (and often
misuse) of fragments of `*talk mode* <../T/talk-mode.html>`__
abbreviations, a long `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__ (sometimes
even a `*doubled sig* <../D/doubled-sig.html>`__), and unbounded
naivete. B1FF posts articles using his elder brother's VIC-20. B1FF's
location is a mystery, as his articles appear to come from a variety of
sites. However, BITNET seems to be the most frequent origin. The theory
that B1FF is a denizen of BITNET is supported by B1FF's (unfortunately
invalid) electronic mail address: B1FF@BIT.NET.

[1993: Now It Can Be Told! My spies inform me that B1FF was originally
created by Joe Talmadge <jat@cup.hp.com>, also the author of the
infamous and much-plagiarized “Flamer's Bible”. The BIFF filter he wrote
was later passed to Richard Sexton, who posted BIFFisms much more
widely. Versions have since been posted for the amusement of the net at
large. See also `*Jeff K.* <../J/Jeff-K-.html>`__ —ESR]
