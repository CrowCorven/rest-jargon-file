**batch**: adj.

1. Non-interactive. Hackers use this somewhat more loosely than the
traditional technical definitions justify; in particular, switches on a
normally interactive program that prepare it to receive non-interactive
command input are often referred to as batch mode switches. A batch file
is a series of instructions written to be handed to an interactive
program running in batch mode.

2. Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting. “I finally sat down
in batch mode and wrote out checks for all those bills; I guess they'll
turn the electricity back on next week...”

3. batching up: Accumulation of a number of small tasks that can be
lumped together for greater efficiency. “I'm batching up those letters
to send sometime” “I'm batching up bottles to take to the recycling
center.”
