**Black Screen of Death**:

[prob.: related to the Floating Head of Death in a famous *Far Side*
cartoon.] A failure mode of `*Microsloth
Windows* <../M/Microsloth-Windows.html>`__. On an attempt to launch a
DOS box, a networked Windows system not uncommonly blanks the screen and
locks up the PC so hard that it requires a cold `*boot* <boot.html>`__
to recover. This unhappy phenomenon is known as The Black Screen of
Death. See also `*Blue Screen of Death* <Blue-Screen-of-Death.html>`__,
which has become rather more common.
