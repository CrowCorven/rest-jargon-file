**banner site**: n.

[warez d00dz] An FTP site storing pirated files where one must first
click on several banners and/or subscribe to various ‘free’ services,
usually generating some form of revenues for the site owner, to be able
to access the site. More often than not, the username/password painfully
obtained by clicking on banners and subscribing to bogus services or
mailing lists turns out to be non-working or gives access to a site that
always responds busy. See `*ratio site* <../R/ratio-site.html>`__,
`*leech mode* <../L/leech-mode.html>`__.
