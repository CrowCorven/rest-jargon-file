**BOF**: /B·O·F/, /bof/, n.

1. [common] Abbreviation for the phrase “Birds Of a Feather” (flocking
together), an informal discussion group and/or bull session scheduled on
a conference program. It is not clear where or when this term
originated, but it is now associated with the USENIX conferences for
Unix techies and was already established there by 1984. It was used
earlier than that at DECUS conferences and is reported to have been
common at SHARE meetings as far back as the early 1960s.

2. Acronym, “Beginning of File”.
