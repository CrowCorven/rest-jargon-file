**broken**: adj.

1. Not working according to design (of programs). This is the mainstream
sense.

2. Improperly designed, This sense carries a more or less disparaging
implication that the designer should have known better, while sense 1
doesn't necessarily assign blame. Which of senses 1 or 2 is intended is
conveyed by context and nonverbal cues.

3. Behaving strangely; especially (when used of people) exhibiting
extreme depression.
