**bubble sort**: n.

Techspeak for a particular sorting technique in which pairs of adjacent
values in the list to be sorted are compared and interchanged if they
are out of order; thus, list entries ‘bubble upward’ in the list until
they bump into one with a lower sort value. Because it is not very good
relative to other methods and is the one typically stumbled on by
`*naive* <../N/naive.html>`__ and untutored programmers, hackers
consider it the `*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ example of a naive
algorithm. (However, it's been shown by repeated experiment that below
about 5000 records bubble-sort is OK anyway.) The canonical example of a
really *bad* algorithm is `*bogo-sort* <bogo-sort.html>`__. A bubble
sort might be used out of ignorance, but any use of bogo-sort could
issue only from brain damage or willful perversity.
