**bottom-up implementation**: n.

Hackish opposite of the techspeak term top-down design. It has been
received wisdom in most programming cultures that it is best to design
from higher levels of abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences of
action in increasing detail until you get to actual code. Hackers often
find (especially in exploratory designs that cannot be closely specified
in advance) that it works best to *build* things in the opposite order,
by writing and testing a clean set of primitive operations and then
knitting them together. Naively applied, this leads to hacked-together
bottom-up implementations; a more sophisticated response is middle-out
implementation, in which scratch code within primitives at the mid-level
of the system is gradually replaced with a more polished version of the
lowest level at the same time the structure above the midlevel is being
built.
