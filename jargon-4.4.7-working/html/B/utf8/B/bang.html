**bang**

1. n. Common spoken name for ``!`` (ASCII 0100001), especially when used
in pronouncing a `*bang path* <bang-path.html>`__ in spoken hackish. In
`*elder days* <../E/elder-days.html>`__ this was considered a CMUish
usage, with MIT and Stanford hackers preferring
`*excl* <../E/excl.html>`__ or `*shriek* <../S/shriek.html>`__; but the
spread of Unix has carried ‘bang’ with it (esp. via the term `*bang
path* <bang-path.html>`__) and it is now certainly the most common
spoken name for ``!``. Note that it is used exclusively for non-emphatic
written ``!``; one would not say “Congratulations bang” (except possibly
for humorous purposes), but if one wanted to specify the exact
characters “foo!” one would speak “Eff oh oh bang”. See
`*shriek* <../S/shriek.html>`__, `*ASCII* <../A/ASCII.html>`__.

2. interj. An exclamation signifying roughly “I have achieved
enlightenment!”, or “The dynamite has cleared out my brain!” Often used
to acknowledge that one has perpetrated a
`*thinko* <../T/thinko.html>`__ immediately after one has been called on
it.
