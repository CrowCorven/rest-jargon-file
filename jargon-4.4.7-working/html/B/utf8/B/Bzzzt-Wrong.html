**Bzzzt! Wrong.**: /bzt rong/, excl.

[common; Usenet/Internet; punctuation varies] From a Robin Williams
routine in the movie *Dead Poets Society* spoofing radio or TV quiz
programs, such as *Truth or Consequences*, where an incorrect answer
earns one a blast from the buzzer and condolences from the interlocutor.
A way of expressing mock-rude disagreement, usually immediately
following an included quote from another poster. The less abbreviated
“\*Bzzzzt\*, wrong, but thank you for playing” is also common;
capitalization and emphasis of the buzzer sound varies.
