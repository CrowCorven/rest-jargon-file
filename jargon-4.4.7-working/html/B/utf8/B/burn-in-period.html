**burn-in period**: n.

1. A factory test designed to catch systems with
`*marginal* <../M/marginal.html>`__ components before they get out the
door; the theory is that burn-in will protect customers by outwaiting
the steepest part of the `*bathtub curve* <bathtub-curve.html>`__ (see
`*infant mortality* <../I/infant-mortality.html>`__).

2. A period of indeterminate length in which a person using a computer
is so intensely involved in his project that he forgets basic needs such
as food, drink, sleep, etc. Warning: Excessive burn-in can lead to
burn-out. See `*hack mode* <../H/hack-mode.html>`__, `*larval
stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__.

Historical note: the origin of “burn-in” (sense 1) is apparently the
practice of setting a new-model airplane's brakes on fire, then
extinguishing the fire, in order to make them hold better. This was done
on the first version of the U.S. spy-plane, the U-2.
