**black hole**: n.,vt.

[common] What data (a piece of email or netnews, or a stream of TCP/IP
packets) has fallen into if it disappears mysteriously between its
origin and destination sites (that is, without returning a `*bounce
message* <bounce-message.html>`__). “I think there's a black hole at
``foovax``!” conveys suspicion that site ``foovax`` has been dropping a
lot of stuff on the floor lately (see `*drop on the
floor* <../D/drop-on-the-floor.html>`__). The implied metaphor of email
as interstellar travel is interesting in itself. Readily verbed as
blackhole: “That router is blackholing IDP packets.” Compare `*bit
bucket* <bit-bucket.html>`__ and see `*RBL* <../R/RBL.html>`__.
