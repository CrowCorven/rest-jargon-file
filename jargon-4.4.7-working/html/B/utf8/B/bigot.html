**bigot**: n.

[common] A person who is religiously attached to a particular computer,
language, operating system, editor, or other tool (see `*religious
issues* <../R/religious-issues.html>`__). Usually found with a
specifier; thus, Cray bigot, ITS bigot, APL bigot, VMS bigot, Berkeley
bigot. Real bigots can be distinguished from mere partisans or zealots
by the fact that they refuse to learn alternatives even when the march
of time and/or technology is threatening to obsolete the favored tool.
It is truly said “You can tell a bigot, but you can't tell him much.”
