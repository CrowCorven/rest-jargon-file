**Bloggs Family**: n.

An imaginary family consisting of Fred and Mary Bloggs and their
children. Used as a standard example in knowledge representation to show
the difference between extensional and intensional objects. For example,
every occurrence of “Fred Bloggs” is the same unique person, whereas
occurrences of “person” may refer to different people. Members of the
Bloggs family have been known to pop up in bizarre places such as the
old `*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ Telephone Directory. Compare `*Dr. Fred
Mbogo* <../D/Dr--Fred-Mbogo.html>`__; `*J. Random
Hacker* <../J/J--Random-Hacker.html>`__; `*Fred
Foobar* <../F/Fred-Foobar.html>`__.
