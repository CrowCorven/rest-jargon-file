**bletcherous**: /blech'@·r@s/, adj.

Disgusting in design or function; esthetically unappealing. This word is
seldom used of people. “This keyboard is bletcherous!” (Perhaps the keys
don't work very well, or are misplaced.) See
`*losing* <../L/losing.html>`__, `*cretinous* <../C/cretinous.html>`__,
`*bagbiting* <bagbiting.html>`__, `*bogus* <bogus.html>`__, and
`*random* <../R/random.html>`__. The term
`*bletcherous* <bletcherous.html>`__ applies to the esthetics of the
thing so described; similarly for `*cretinous* <../C/cretinous.html>`__.
By contrast, something that is losing or bagbiting may be failing to
meet objective criteria. See also `*bogus* <bogus.html>`__ and
`*random* <../R/random.html>`__, which have richer and wider shades of
meaning than any of the above.
