**BLT**: /B·L·T/, /bl@t/, /belt/, n.,vt.

Synonym for `*blit* <blit.html>`__. This is the original form of
`*blit* <blit.html>`__ and the ancestor of `*bitblt* <bitblt.html>`__.
It referred to any large bit-field copy or move operation (one
resource-intensive memory-shuffling operation done on pre-paged versions
of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was sardonically referred to as “The Big
BLT”). The jargon usage has outlasted the
`*PDP-10* <../P/PDP-10.html>`__ BLock Transfer instruction from which
`*BLT* <BLT.html>`__ derives; nowadays, the assembler mnemonic
`*BLT* <BLT.html>`__ almost always means “Branch if Less Than zero”.
