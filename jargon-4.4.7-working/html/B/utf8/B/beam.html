[from Star Trek Classic's “Beam me up, Scotty!”]

1. To transfer `*softcopy* <../S/softcopy.html>`__ of a file
electronically; most often in combining forms such as beam me a copy or
beam that over to his site.

2. Palm Pilot users very commonly use this term for the act of
exchanging bits via the infrared links on their machines (this term
seems to have originated with the ill-fated Newton Message Pad). Compare
`*blast* <blast.html>`__, `*snarf* <../S/snarf.html>`__,
`*BLT* <BLT.html>`__.
