**Bad Thing**: n.

[very common; always pronounced as if capitalized. Orig. fr. the 1930
Sellar & Yeatman parody of British history *1066 And All That*, but
well-established among hackers in the U.S. as well.] Something that
can't possibly result in improvement of the subject. This term is always
capitalized, as in “Replacing all of the DSL links with bicycle couriers
would be a Bad Thing”. Oppose `*Good Thing* <../G/Good-Thing.html>`__.
British correspondents confirm that `*Bad Thing* <Bad-Thing.html>`__ and
`*Good Thing* <../G/Good-Thing.html>`__ (and prob. therefore `*Right
Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__ and `*Wrong
Thing* <../W/Wrong-Thing.html>`__) come from the book referenced in the
etymology, which discusses rulers who were Good Kings but Bad Things.
This has apparently created a mainstream idiom on the British side of
the pond. It is very common among American hackers, but not in
mainstream usage in the U.S. Compare `*Bad and
Wrong* <Bad-and-Wrong.html>`__.
