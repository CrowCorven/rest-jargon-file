**balloonian variable**: n.

[Commodore users; perh. a deliberate phonetic mangling of boolean
variable?] Any variable that doesn't actually hold or control state, but
must nevertheless be declared, checked, or set. A typical balloonian
variable started out as a flag attached to some environment feature that
either became obsolete or was planned but never implemented.
Compatibility concerns (or politics attached to same) may require that
such a flag be treated as though it were `*live* <../L/live.html>`__.
