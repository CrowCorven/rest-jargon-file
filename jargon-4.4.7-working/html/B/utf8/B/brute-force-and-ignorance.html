**brute force and ignorance**: n.

A popular design technique at many software houses — `*brute
force* <brute-force.html>`__ coding unrelieved by any knowledge of how
problems have been previously solved in elegant ways. Dogmatic adherence
to design methodologies tends to encourage this sort of thing.
Characteristic of early `*larval stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__
programming; unfortunately, many never outgrow it. Often abbreviated
BFI: “Gak, they used a `*bubble sort* <bubble-sort.html>`__! That's
strictly from BFI.” Compare `*bogosity* <bogosity.html>`__. A very
similar usage is said to be mainstream in Great Britain.
