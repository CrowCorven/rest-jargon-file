**bit rot**: n.

[common] Also `*bit decay* <bit-decay.html>`__. Hypothetical disease the
existence of which has been deduced from the observation that unused
programs or features will often stop working after sufficient time has
passed, even if ‘nothing has changed’. The theory explains that bits
decay as if they were radioactive. As time passes, the contents of a
file or the code in a program will become increasingly garbled.

There actually are physical processes that produce such effects (alpha
particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip packages, for
example, can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably, and
various kinds of subtle media failures can corrupt files in mass
storage), but they are quite rare (and computers are built with
error-detecting circuitry to compensate for them). The notion long
favored among hackers that cosmic rays are among the causes of such
events turns out to be a myth; see the `*cosmic
rays* <../C/cosmic-rays.html>`__ entry for details.

The term `*software rot* <../S/software-rot.html>`__ is almost
synonymous. Software rot is the effect, bit rot the notional cause.
