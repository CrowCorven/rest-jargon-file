**background**: n.,adj.,vt.

[common] To do a task in background is to do it whenever
`*foreground* <../F/foreground.html>`__ matters are not claiming your
undivided attention, and to background something means to relegate it to
a lower priority. “For now, we'll just print a list of nodes and links;
I'm working on the graph-printing problem in background.” Note that this
implies ongoing activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in
contrast to mainstream ‘back burner’ (which connotes benign neglect
until some future resumption of activity). Some people prefer to use the
term for processing that they have queued up for their unconscious minds
(a tack that one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle
in creative work). Compare `*amp off* <../A/amp-off.html>`__,
`*slopsucker* <../S/slopsucker.html>`__.

Technically, a task running in background is detached from the terminal
where it was started (and often running at a lower priority); oppose
`*foreground* <../F/foreground.html>`__. Nowadays this term is primarily
associated with `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__, but it appears to have been
first used in this sense on OS/360.
