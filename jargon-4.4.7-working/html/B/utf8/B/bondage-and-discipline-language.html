**bondage-and-discipline language**: n.

A language (such as `*Pascal* <../P/Pascal.html>`__, Ada, APL, or
Prolog) that, though ostensibly general-purpose, is designed so as to
enforce an author's theory of ‘right programming’ even though said
theory is demonstrably inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla
general-purpose programming. Often abbreviated ‘B&D’; thus, one may
speak of things “having the B&D nature”. See
`*Pascal* <../P/Pascal.html>`__; oppose `*languages of
choice* <../L/languages-of-choice.html>`__.
