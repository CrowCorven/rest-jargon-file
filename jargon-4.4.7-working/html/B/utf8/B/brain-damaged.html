**brain-damaged**: adj.

1. [common; generalization of “Honeywell Brain Damage” (HBD), a
theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in
Honeywell `*Multics* <../M/Multics.html>`__] adj. Obviously wrong;
`*cretinous* <../C/cretinous.html>`__;
`*demented* <../D/demented.html>`__. There is an implication that the
person responsible must have suffered brain damage, because he should
have known better. Calling something brain-damaged is really bad; it
also implies it is unusable, and that its failure to work is due to poor
design rather than some accident. “Only six monocase characters per file
name? Now *that's* brain-damaged!”

2. [esp. in the Mac world] May refer to free demonstration software that
has been deliberately crippled in some way so as not to compete with the
product it is intended to sell. Syn.
`*crippleware* <../C/crippleware.html>`__.
