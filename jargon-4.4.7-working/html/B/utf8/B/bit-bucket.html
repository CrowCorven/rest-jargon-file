**bit bucket**: n.

[very common]

1. The universal data sink (originally, the mythical receptacle used to
catch bits when they fall off the end of a register during a shift
instruction). Discarded, lost, or destroyed data is said to have gone to
the bit bucket. On `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__, often used for
`*/dev/null* <../0/dev-null.html>`__. Sometimes amplified as the Great
Bit Bucket in the Sky.

2. The place where all lost mail and news messages eventually go. The
selection is performed according to `*Finagle's
Law* <../F/Finagles-Law.html>`__; important mail is much more likely to
end up in the bit bucket than junk mail, which has an almost 100%
probability of getting delivered. Routing to the bit bucket is
automatically performed by mail-transfer agents, news systems, and the
lower layers of the network.

3. The ideal location for all unwanted mail responses: “Flames about
this article to the bit bucket.” Such a request is guaranteed to
overflow one's mailbox with flames.

4. Excuse for all mail that has not been sent. “I mailed you those
figures last week; they must have landed in the bit bucket.” Compare
`*black hole* <black-hole.html>`__.

This term is used purely in jest. It is based on the fanciful notion
that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only misplaced. This
appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term ‘bit box’, about
which the same legend was current; old-time hackers also report that
trainees used to be told that when the CPU stored bits into memory it
was actually pulling them “out of the bit box”. See also `*chad
box* <../C/chad-box.html>`__.

Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the
“parity preservation law”, the number of 1 bits that go to the bit
bucket must equal the number of 0 bits. Any imbalance results in bits
filling up the bit bucket. A qualified computer technician can empty a
full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.

The source for all these meanings, is, historically, the fact that the
`*chad box* <../C/chad-box.html>`__ on a paper-tape punch was sometimes
called a bit bucket.
