**Big Red Switch**: n.

[IBM] The power switch on a computer, esp. the ‘Emergency Pull’ switch
on an IBM `*mainframe* <../M/mainframe.html>`__ or the power switch on
an IBM PC where it really is large and red. “This !@%$% `*bitty
box* <bitty-box.html>`__ is hung again; time to hit the Big Red Switch.”
Sources at IBM report that, in tune with the company's passion for
`*TLA* <../T/TLA.html>`__\ s, this is often abbreviated as BRS (this has
also become established on FidoNet and in the PC
`*clone* <../C/clone.html>`__ world). It is alleged that the emergency
pull switch on an IBM 360/91 actually fired a non-conducting bolt into
the main power feed; the BRSes on more recent mainframes physically drop
a block into place so that they can't be pushed back in. People get
fired for pulling them, especially inappropriately (see also
`*molly-guard* <../M/molly-guard.html>`__). Compare `*power
cycle* <../P/power-cycle.html>`__, `*three-finger
salute* <../T/three-finger-salute.html>`__; see also `*scram
switch* <../S/scram-switch.html>`__.
