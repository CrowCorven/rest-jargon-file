**bang path**: n.

[now historical] An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address specifying
hops to get from some assumed-reachable location to the addressee, so
called because each `*hop* <../H/hop.html>`__ is signified by a
`*bang* <bang.html>`__ sign. Thus, for example, the path
``...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me`` directs people to route their mail to
machine ``bigsite`` (presumably a well-known location accessible to
everybody) and from there through the machine ``foovax`` to the account
of user ``me`` on ``barbox``.

In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers and
Internet became commonplace, people often published compound bang
addresses using the { } convention (see `*glob* <../G/glob.html>`__) to
give paths from *several* big machines, in the hopes that one's
correspondent might be able to get mail to one of them reliably
(example: ``...!{seismo, ut-sally,    ihnp4``!rice!beta!gamma!me}). Bang
paths of 8 to 10 hops were not uncommon. Late-night dial-up UUCP links
would cause week-long transmission times. Bang paths were often selected
by both transmission time and reliability, as messages would not
infrequently get lost. See `*the network* <../T/the-network.html>`__ and
`*sitename* <../S/sitename.html>`__.
