**broket**: /broh´k@t/, /broh´ket\`/, n.

[rare; by analogy with ‘bracket’: a ‘broken bracket’] Either of the
characters ``<`` and ``>``, when used as paired enclosing delimiters.
This word originated as a contraction of the phrase ‘broken bracket’,
that is, a bracket that is bent in the middle. (At MIT, and apparently
in the `*Real World* <../R/Real-World.html>`__ as well, these are
usually called `*angle brackets* <../A/angle-brackets.html>`__.)
