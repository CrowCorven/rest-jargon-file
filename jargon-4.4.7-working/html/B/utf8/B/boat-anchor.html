**boat anchor**: n.

[common; from ham radio]

1. Like `*doorstop* <../D/doorstop.html>`__ but more severe; implies
that the offending hardware is irreversibly dead or useless. “That was a
working motherboard once. One lightning strike later, instant boat
anchor!”

2. A person who just takes up space.

3. Obsolete but still working hardware, especially when used of an old,
bulky, quirky system; originally a term of annoyance, but became more
and more affectionate as the hardware became more and more obsolete.

Auctioneers use this term for a large, undesirable object such as a
washing machine; actual boating enthusiasts, however, use “mooring
anchor” for frustrating (not actually useless) equipment.
