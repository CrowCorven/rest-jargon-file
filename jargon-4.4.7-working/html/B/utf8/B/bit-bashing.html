**bit bashing**: n.

(alt.: bit diddling or `*bit twiddling* <bit-twiddling.html>`__) Term
used to describe any of several kinds of low-level programming
characterized by manipulation of `*bit* <bit.html>`__,
`*flag* <../F/flag.html>`__, `*nybble* <../N/nybble.html>`__, and other
smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data; these include low-level
device control, encryption algorithms, checksum and error-correcting
codes, hash functions, some flavors of graphics programming (see
`*bitblt* <bitblt.html>`__), and assembler/compiler code generation. May
connote either tedium or a real technical challenge (more usually the
former). “The command decoding for the new tape driver looks pretty
solid but the bit-bashing for the control registers still has bugs.” See
also `*mode bit* <../M/mode-bit.html>`__.
