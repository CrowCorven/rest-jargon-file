**backbone cabal**: n.

A group of large-site administrators who pushed through the `*Great
Renaming* <../G/Great-Renaming.html>`__ and reined in the chaos of
`*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ during most of the 1980s. During most of
its lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized) steadfastly
denied its own existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy to
their secrets to respond “There is no Cabal” whenever the existence or
activities of the group were speculated on in public.

The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery. Even a
decade after the cabal `*mailing list* <../M/mailing-list.html>`__
disbanded in late 1988 following a bitter internal catfight, many people
believed (or claimed to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but
only gone deeper underground with its power intact.

This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about various
Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over the
Usenet or Internet. These paranoias were later satirized in ways that
took on a life of their own. See `*Eric
Conspiracy* <../E/Eric-Conspiracy.html>`__ for one example. Part of the
background for this kind of humor is that many hackers cultivate a
fondness for conspiracy theory considered as a kind of surrealist art;
see the bibliography entry om *Illuminatus!* for the novel that launched
this trend.

See `*NANA* <../N/NANA.html>`__ for the subsequent history of “the
Cabal”.
