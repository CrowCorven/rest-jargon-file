**Batman factor**: n.

1. An integer number representing the number of items hanging from a
`*batbelt* <batbelt.html>`__. In most settings, a Batman factor of more
than 3 is not acceptable without odd stares and whispering. This
encourages the hacker in question to choose items for the batbelt
carefully to avoid awkward social situations, usually amongst
non-hackers.

2. A somewhat more vaguely defined index of contribution to sense 1.
Devices that are especially obtrusive, such as large, older model cell
phones, “Pocket” PC devices and walkie talkies are said to have a high
batman factor. Sleeker devices such as a later-model Palm or StarTac
phone are prized for their low batman factor and lessened obtrusiveness
and weight.
