**Blue Screen of Death**: n.

[common] This term is closely related to the older `*Black Screen of
Death* <Black-Screen-of-Death.html>`__ but much more common (many
non-hackers have picked it up). Due to the extreme fragility and
bugginess of Microsoft Windows, misbehaving applications can readily
crash the OS (and the OS sometimes crashes itself spontaneously). The
Blue Screen of Death, sometimes decorated with hex error codes, is what
you get when this happens. (Commonly abbreviated
`*BSOD* <BSOD.html>`__.) The following entry from the `Salon Haiku
Contest <http://archive.salon.com/21st/chal/1998/02/10chal.html>`__,
seems to have predated popular use of the term:

| 
|          Windows NT crashed.
|          I am the Blue Screen of Death
|          No one hears your screams.
