**Bad and Wrong**: adj.

[Durham, UK] Said of something that is both badly designed and wrongly
executed. This common term is the prototype of, and is used by contrast
with, three less common terms — Bad and Right (a kludge, something ugly
but functional); Good and Wrong (an overblown GUI or other attractive
nuisance); and (rare praise) Good and Right. These terms entered common
use at Durham c.1994 and may have been imported from elsewhere; they are
also in use at Oxford, and the emphatic form “Evil and Bad and Wrong”
(abbreviated EBW) is reported from there. There are standard
abbreviations: they start with B&R, a typo for “Bad and Wrong”.
Consequently, B&W is actually “Bad and Right”, G&R = “Good and Wrong”,
and G&W = “Good and Right”. Compare `*evil and
rude* <../E/evil-and-rude.html>`__, `*Good
Thing* <../G/Good-Thing.html>`__, `*Bad Thing* <Bad-Thing.html>`__.
