**Blue Glue**: n.

[IBM; obs.] IBM's SNA (Systems Network Architecture), an incredibly
`*losing* <../L/losing.html>`__ and `*bletcherous* <bletcherous.html>`__
communications protocol once widely favored at commercial shops that
didn't know any better (like other proprietary networking protocols, it
became obsolete and effectively disappeared after the Internet explosion
c.1994). The official IBM definition is “that which binds blue boxes
together.” See `*fear and loathing* <../F/fear-and-loathing.html>`__. It
may not be irrelevant that Blue Glue is the trade name of a 3M product
that is commonly used to hold down the carpet squares to the removable
panel floors common in `*dinosaur pen* <../D/dinosaur-pen.html>`__\ s. A
correspondent at U. Minn. reports that the CS department there has about
80 bottles of the stuff hanging about, so they often refer to any messy
work to be done as using the blue glue.
