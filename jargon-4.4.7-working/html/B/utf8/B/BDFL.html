**BDFL**

[Python; common] Benevolent Dictator For Life.
`*Guido* <../G/Guido.html>`__, considered in his role as the project
leader of `*Python* <../P/Python.html>`__. People who are feeling
temporarily cheesed off by one of his decisions sometimes leave off the
B. The mental image that goes with this, of a cigar-chomping caudillo in
gold braid and sunglasses, is extremely funny to anyone who has ever met
Guido in person.
