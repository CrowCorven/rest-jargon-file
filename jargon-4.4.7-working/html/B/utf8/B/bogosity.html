**bogosity**: /boh·go´s@·tee/, n.

1. [orig. CMU, now very common] The degree to which something is
`*bogus* <bogus.html>`__. Bogosity is measured with a
`*bogometer* <bogometer.html>`__; in a seminar, when a speaker says
something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say “My bogometer
just triggered”. More extremely, “You just pinned my bogometer” means
you just said or did something so outrageously bogus that it is off the
scale, pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible reading (one
might also say “You just redlined my bogometer”). The agreed-upon unit
of bogosity is the `*microLenat* <../M/microLenat.html>`__.

2. The potential field generated by a `*bogon
flux* <bogon-flux.html>`__; see `*quantum
bogodynamics* <../Q/quantum-bogodynamics.html>`__. See also `*bogon
flux* <bogon-flux.html>`__, `*bogon filter* <bogon-filter.html>`__,
`*bogus* <bogus.html>`__.
