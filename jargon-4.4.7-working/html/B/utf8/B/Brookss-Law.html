**Brooks's Law**: prov.

“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” — a result
of the fact that the expected advantage from splitting development work
among ``N`` programmers is ``O(N)`` (that is, proportional to ``N``),
but the complexity and communications cost associated with coordinating
and then merging their work is ``O(N^2)`` (that is, proportional to the
square of ``N``). The quote is from Fred Brooks, a manager of IBM's
OS/360 project and author of *The Mythical Man-Month* (Addison-Wesley,
1975, ISBN 0-201-00650-2), an excellent early book on software
engineering. The myth in question has been most tersely expressed as
“Programmer time is fungible” and Brooks established conclusively that
it is not. Hackers have never forgotten his advice (though it's not the
whole story; see `*bazaar* <bazaar.html>`__); too often,
`*management* <../M/management.html>`__ still does. See also
`*creationism* <../C/creationism.html>`__, `*second-system
effect* <../S/second-system-effect.html>`__,
`*optimism* <../O/optimism.html>`__.
