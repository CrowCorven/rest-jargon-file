**blogosphere**

The totality of all `*blog* <blog.html>`__\ s. A culture heavily
overlapping with but not coincident with hackerdom; a few of its key
coinages (`*blogrolling* <blogrolling.html>`__,
`*fisking* <../F/fisking.html>`__,
`*anti-idiotarianism* <../A/anti-idiotarianism.html>`__) are recorded in
this lexicon for flavor. Bloggers often divide themselves into
warbloggers and techbloggers. The techbloggers write about technology
and technology policy, while the warbloggers are more politically
focused and tend to be preoccupied with U.S. and world response to the
post-9/11 war against terrorism. The overlap with hackerdom is heaviest
among the techbloggers, but several of the most prominent warbloggers
are also hackers. Bloggers in general tend to be aware of and
sympathetic to the hacker culture.
