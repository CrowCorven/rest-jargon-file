**bounce**: v.

1. [common; perhaps by analogy to a bouncing check] An electronic mail
message that is undeliverable and returns an error notification to the
sender is said to bounce. See also `*bounce
message* <bounce-message.html>`__.

2. To engage in sexual intercourse; prob.: from the expression ‘bouncing
the mattress’, but influenced by Roo's psychosexually loaded “Try
bouncing me, Tigger!” from the *Winnie-the-Pooh* books. Compare
`*boink* <boink.html>`__.

3. To casually reboot a system in order to clear up a transient problem
(possibly editing a configuration file in the process, if it is one that
is only re-read at boot time). Reported primarily among
`*VMS* <../V/VMS.html>`__ and `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__ users.

4. [VM/CMS programmers] *Automatic* warm-start of a machine after an
error. “I logged on this morning and found it had bounced 7 times during
the night”

6. [IBM] To `*power cycle* <../P/power-cycle.html>`__ a peripheral in
order to reset it.
