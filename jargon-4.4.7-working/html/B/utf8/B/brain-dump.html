**brain dump**: n.

[common] The act of telling someone everything one knows about a
particular topic or project. Typically used when someone is going to let
a new party maintain a piece of code. Conceptually analogous to an
operating system `*core dump* <../C/core-dump.html>`__ in that it saves
a lot of useful `*state* <../S/state.html>`__ before an exit. “You'll
have to give me a brain dump on FOOBAR before you start your new job at
HackerCorp.” See `*core dump* <../C/core-dump.html>`__ (sense 4). At
Sun, this is also known as TOI (transfer of information).
