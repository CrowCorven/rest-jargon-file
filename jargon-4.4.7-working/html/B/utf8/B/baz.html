**baz**: /baz/, n.

1. [common] The third `*metasyntactic
variable* <../M/metasyntactic-variable.html>`__ “Suppose we have three
functions: FOO, BAR, and BAZ. FOO calls BAR, which calls BAZ....” (See
also `*fum* <../F/fum.html>`__)

2. interj. A term of mild annoyance. In this usage the term is often
drawn out for 2 or 3 seconds, producing an effect not unlike the
bleating of a sheep; /baaaaaaz/.

3. Occasionally appended to `*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__ to produce
‘foobaz’.

Earlier versions of this lexicon derived baz as a Stanford corruption of
`*bar* <bar.html>`__. However, Pete Samson (compiler of the
`*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__ lexicon) reports it was already current when
he joined TMRC in 1958. He says “It came from *Pogo*. Albert the
Alligator, when vexed or outraged, would shout ‘Bazz Fazz!’ or
‘Rowrbazzle!’ The club layout was said to model the (mythical) New
England counties of Rowrfolk and Bassex (Rowrbazzle mingled with
(Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex).”
