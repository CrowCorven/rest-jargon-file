**biff**: /bif/, vt.

[now rare] To notify someone of incoming mail. From the BSD utility
biff(1), which was in turn named after a friendly dog who used to chase
frisbees in the halls at UCB while 4.2BSD was in development. There was
a legend that it had a habit of barking whenever the mailman came, but
the author of **biff** says this is not true. No relation to
`*B1FF* <B1FF.html>`__.
