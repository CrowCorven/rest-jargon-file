**bells and whistles**: n.

[common] Features added to a program or system to make it more
`*flavorful* <../F/flavorful.html>`__ from a hacker's point of view,
without necessarily adding to its utility for its primary function.
Distinguished from `*chrome* <../C/chrome.html>`__, which is intended to
attract users. “Now that we've got the basic program working, let's go
back and add some bells and whistles.” No one seems to know what
distinguishes a bell from a whistle. The recognized emphatic form is
“bells, whistles, and gongs”.

It used to be thought that this term derived from the toyboxes on
theater organs. However, the “and gongs” strongly suggests a different
origin, at sea. Before powered horns, ships routinely used bells,
whistles, and gongs to signal each other over longer distances than
voice can carry.
