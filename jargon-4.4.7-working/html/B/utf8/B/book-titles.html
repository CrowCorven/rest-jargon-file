**book titles**

There is a tradition in hackerdom of informally tagging important
textbooks and standards documents with the dominant color of their
covers or with some other conspicuous feature of the cover. Many of
these are described in this lexicon under their own entries. See
`*Aluminum Book* <../A/Aluminum-Book.html>`__, `*Camel
Book* <../C/Camel-Book.html>`__, `*Cinderella
Book* <../C/Cinderella-Book.html>`__, `*daemon
book* <../D/daemon-book.html>`__, `*Dragon
Book* <../D/Dragon-Book.html>`__, `*Orange
Book* <../O/Orange-Book.html>`__, `*Purple
Book* <../P/Purple-Book.html>`__, `*Wizard
Book* <../W/Wizard-Book.html>`__, and `*bible* <bible.html>`__; see also
`*rainbow series* <../R/rainbow-series.html>`__. Since about 1993 this
tradition has gotten a boost from the popular O'Reilly and Associates
line of technical books, which usually feature some kind of exotic
animal on the cover and are often called by the name of that animal.
