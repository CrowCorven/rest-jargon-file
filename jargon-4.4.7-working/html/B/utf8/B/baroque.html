**baroque**: adj.

[common] Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on excessive. Said
of hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has many of the
connotations of `*elephantine* <../E/elephantine.html>`__ or
`*monstrosity* <../M/monstrosity.html>`__ but is less extreme and not
pejorative in itself. In the absence of other, more negative
descriptions this term suggests that the software is trembling on the
edge of bad taste but has not quite tipped over into it. “Metafont even
has features to introduce random variations to its letterform output.
Now *that* is baroque!” See also `*rococo* <../R/rococo.html>`__.
