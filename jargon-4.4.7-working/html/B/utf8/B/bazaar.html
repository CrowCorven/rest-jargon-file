**bazaar**: n.,adj.

In 1997, after meditating on the success of
`*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ for three years, the Jargon File's own
editor ESR wrote an analytical paper on hacker culture and development
models titled `The Cathedral and the
Bazaar <http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/>`__. The
main argument of the paper was that `*Brooks's
Law* <Brookss-Law.html>`__ is not the whole story; given the right
social machinery, debugging can be efficiently parallelized across large
numbers of programmers. The title metaphor caught on (see also
`*cathedral* <../C/cathedral.html>`__), and the style of development
typical in the Linux community is now often referred to as the bazaar
mode. Its characteristics include releasing code early and often, and
actively seeking the largest possible pool of peer reviewers. After
1998, the evident success of this way of doing things became one of the
strongest arguments for `*open source* <../O/open-source.html>`__.
