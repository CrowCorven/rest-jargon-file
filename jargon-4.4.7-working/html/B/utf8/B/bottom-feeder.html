**bottom feeder**: n.

1. An Internet user that leeches off ISPs — the sort you can never
provide good enough services for, always complains about the price, no
matter how low it may be, and will bolt off to another service the
moment there is even the slimmest price difference. While most bottom
feeders infest free or almost free services such as AOL, MSN, and
Hotmail, too many flock to whomever happens to be the cheapest regional
ISP at the time. Bottom feeders are often the classic problem user,
known for unleashing spam, flamage, and other breaches of
`*netiquette* <../N/netiquette.html>`__.

2. Syn. for `*slopsucker* <../S/slopsucker.html>`__, derived from the
fishermen's and naturalists' term for finny creatures who subsist on the
primordial ooze. (This sense is older.)
