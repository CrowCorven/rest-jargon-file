BiCapitalization

**BiCapitalization**: n.

The act said to have been performed on trademarks (such as
`*PostScript* <../P/PostScript.html>`__, NeXT,
`*NeWS* <../N/NeWS.html>`__, VisiCalc, FrameMaker, TK!solver,
EasyWriter) that have been raised above the ruck of common coinage by
nonstandard capitalization. Too many
`*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__ types think this sort of thing
is really cute, even the 2,317th time they do it. Compare
`*studlycaps* <../S/studlycaps.html>`__,
`*InterCaps* <../I/InterCaps.html>`__.
