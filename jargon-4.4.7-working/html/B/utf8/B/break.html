**break**

1. vt. To cause to be `*broken* <broken.html>`__ (in any sense). “Your
latest patch to the editor broke the paragraph commands.”

2. v. (of a program) To stop temporarily, so that it may debugged. The
place where it stops is a breakpoint.

3. [techspeak] vi. To send an RS-232 break (two character widths of line
high) over a serial comm line.

4. [Unix] vi. To strike whatever key currently causes the tty driver to
send SIGINT to the current process. Normally, break (sense 3), delete or
`*control-C* <../C/control-C.html>`__ does this.

5. break break may be said to interrupt a conversation (this is an
example of verb doubling). This usage comes from radio communications,
which in turn probably came from landline telegraph/teleprinter usage,
as badly abused in the Citizen's Band craze of the early 1980s.
