**blit**: /blit/, vt.

1. [common] To copy a large array of bits from one part of a computer's
memory to another part, particularly when the memory is being used to
determine what is shown on a display screen. “The storage allocator
picks through the table and copies the good parts up into high memory,
and then blits it all back down again.” See `*bitblt* <bitblt.html>`__,
`*BLT* <BLT.html>`__, `*dd* <../D/dd.html>`__,
`*cat* <../C/cat.html>`__, `*blast* <blast.html>`__,
`*snarf* <../S/snarf.html>`__. More generally, to perform some operation
(such as toggling) on a large array of bits while moving them.

2. [historical, rare] Sometimes all-capitalized as BLIT: an early
experimental bit-mapped terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs,
later commercialized as the AT&T 5620. (The folk etymology from “Bell
Labs Intelligent Terminal” is incorrect. Its creators liked to claim
that “Blit” stood for the Bacon, Lettuce, and Interactive Tomato.)
