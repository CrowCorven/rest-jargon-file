**breath-of-life packet**: n.

[XEROX PARC] An Ethernet packet that contains bootstrap (see
`*boot* <boot.html>`__) code, periodically sent out from a working
computer to infuse the ‘breath of life’ into any computer on the network
that has happened to crash. Machines depending on such packets have
sufficient hardware or firmware code to wait for (or request) such a
packet during the reboot process. See also `*dickless
workstation* <../D/dickless-workstation.html>`__.

The notional kiss-of-death packet, with a function complementary to that
of a breath-of-life packet, is recommended for dealing with hosts that
consume too many network resources. Though ‘kiss-of-death packet’ is
usually used in jest, there is at least one documented instance of an
Internet subnet with limited address-table slots in a gateway machine in
which such packets were routinely used to compete for slots, rather like
Christmas shoppers competing for scarce parking spaces.
