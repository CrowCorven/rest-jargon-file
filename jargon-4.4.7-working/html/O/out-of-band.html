**out-of-band**: adj.

[from telecommunications and network theory]

1. In software, describes values of a function which are not in its
‘natural’ range of return values, but are rather signals that some kind
of exception has occurred. Many C functions, for example, return a
nonnegative integral value, but indicate failure with an out-of-band
return value of −1. Compare `*hidden flag* <../H/hidden-flag.html>`__,
`*green bytes* <../G/green-bytes.html>`__,
`*fence* <../F/fence.html>`__.

2. Also sometimes used to describe what communications people call shift
characters, such as the ESC that leads control sequences for many
terminals, or the level shift indicators in the old 5-bit Baudot codes.

3. In personal communication, using methods other than email, such as
telephones or `*snail-mail* <../S/snail-mail.html>`__.
