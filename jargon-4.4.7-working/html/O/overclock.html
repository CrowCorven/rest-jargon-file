**overclock**: /oh´vr·klok´/, vt.

To operate a CPU or other digital logic device at a rate higher than it
was designed for, under the assumption that the manufacturer put some
`*slop* <../S/slop.html>`__ into the specification to account for
manufacturing tolerances. Overclocking something can result in
intermittent `*crash* <../C/crash.html>`__\ es, and can even burn things
out, since power dissipation is directly proportional to
`*clock* <../C/clock.html>`__ frequency. People who make a hobby of this
are sometimes called “overclockers”; they are thrilled that they can run
their CPU a few percent faster, even though they can only tell the
difference by running a `*benchmark* <../B/benchmark.html>`__ program.
See also `*case mod* <../C/case-mod.html>`__.
