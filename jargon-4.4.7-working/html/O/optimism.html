**optimism**: n.

What a programmer is full of after fixing the last bug and before
discovering the *next* last bug. Fred Brooks's book *The Mythical
Man-Month* (See *Brooks's Law*) contains the following paragraph that
describes this extremely well:

    All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery
    especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy
    godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away
    all but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is
    merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the
    young are always optimists. But however the selection process works,
    the result is indisputable: “This time it will surely run,” or “I
    just found the last bug.”.
