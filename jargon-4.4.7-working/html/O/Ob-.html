**Ob-**: /ob/, pref.

Obligatory. A piece of `*netiquette* <../N/netiquette.html>`__
acknowledging that the author has been straying from the newsgroup's
charter topic. For example, if a posting in alt.sex is a response to a
part of someone else's posting that has nothing particularly to do with
sex, the author may append ‘ObSex’ (or ‘Obsex’) and toss off a question
or vignette about some unusual erotic act. It is considered a sign of
great `*winnitude* <../W/winnitude.html>`__ when one's Obs are more
interesting than other people's whole postings.
