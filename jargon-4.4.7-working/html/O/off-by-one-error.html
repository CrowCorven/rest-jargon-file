--------------

**off-by-one error**: n.

[common] Exceedingly common error induced in many ways, such as by
starting at 0 when you should have started at 1 or vice-versa, or by
writing **< N** instead of **<= N** or vice-versa. Also applied to
giving something to the person next to the one who should have gotten
it. Often confounded with `*fencepost
error* <../F/fencepost-error.html>`__, which is properly a particular
subtype of it.
