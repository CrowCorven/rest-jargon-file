**on the gripping hand**

In the progression that starts “On the one hand...” and continues “On
the other hand...” mainstream English may add “on the third hand...”
even though most people don't have three hands. Among hackers, it is
just as likely to be “on the gripping hand”. This metaphor supplied the
title of Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle's 1993 SF novel “The Gripping
Hand” which involved a species of hostile aliens with three arms (the
same species, in fact, referenced in `*juggling
eggs* <../J/juggling-eggs.html>`__). As with
`*TANSTAAFL* <../T/TANSTAAFL.html>`__ and `*con* <../C/con_.html>`__,
this usage became one of the naturalized imports from SF fandom
frequently observed among hackers.
