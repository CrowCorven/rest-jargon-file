**oriental food**: n.

Hackers display an intense tropism towards oriental cuisine, especially
Chinese, and especially of the spicier varieties such as Szechuan and
Hunan. This phenomenon (which has also been observed in subcultures that
overlap heavily with hackerdom, most notably science-fiction fandom) has
never been satisfactorily explained, but is sufficiently intense that
one can assume the target of a hackish dinner expedition to be the best
local Chinese place and be right at least three times out of four. See
also `*ravs* <../R/ravs.html>`__,

chicken* <../L/laser-chicken.html>`__, `*Yu-Shiang Whole
Fish* <../Y/Yu-Shiang-Whole-Fish.html>`__. Thai, Indian, Korean,
Burmese, and Vietnamese cuisines are also quite popular.
