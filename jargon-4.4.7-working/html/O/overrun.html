**overrun**: n.

1. [techspeak] Term for a frequent consequence of data arriving faster
than it can be consumed, esp. in serial line communications. For
example, at 9600 baud there is almost exactly one character per
millisecond, so if a `*silo* <../S/silo.html>`__ can hold only two
characters and the machine takes longer than 2 msec to get to service
the interrupt, at least one character will be lost.

2. Also applied to non-serial-I/O communications. “I forgot to pay my
electric bill due to mail overrun.” “Sorry, I got four phone calls in 3
minutes last night and lost your message to overrun.” When
`*thrash* <../T/thrash.html>`__\ ing at tasks, the next person to make a
request might be told “Overrun!” Compare `*firehose
syndrome* <../F/firehose-syndrome.html>`__.

3. More loosely, may refer to a `*buffer
overflow* <../B/buffer-overflow.html>`__ not necessarily related to
processing time (as in `*overrun screw* <overrun-screw.html>`__).
