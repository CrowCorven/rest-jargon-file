**overflow bit**: n.

1. [techspeak] A `*flag* <../F/flag.html>`__ on some processors
indicating an attempt to calculate a result too large for a register to
hold.

2. More generally, an indication of any kind of capacity overload
condition. “Well, the Ada description was
`*baroque* <../B/baroque.html>`__ all right, but I could hack it OK
until they got to the exception handling ... that set my overflow bit.”

3. The hypothetical bit that will be set if a hacker doesn't get to make
a trip to the Room of Porcelain Fixtures: “I'd better process an
internal interrupt before the overflow bit gets set.”
