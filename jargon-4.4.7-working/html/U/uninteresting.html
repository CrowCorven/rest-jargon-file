**uninteresting**: adj.

1. Said of a problem that, although
`*nontrivial* <../N/nontrivial.html>`__, can be solved simply by
throwing sufficient resources at it.

2. Also said of problems for which a solution would neither advance the
state of the art nor be fun to design and code.

Hackers regard uninteresting problems as intolerable wastes of time, to
be solved (if at all) by lesser mortals. *Real* hackers (see
`*toolsmith* <../T/toolsmith.html>`__) generalize uninteresting problems
enough to make them interesting and solve them — thus solving the
original problem as a special case (and, it must be admitted,
occasionally turning a molehill into a mountain, or a mountain into a
tectonic plate). See `*WOMBAT* <../W/WOMBAT.html>`__,
`*SMOP* <../S/SMOP.html>`__; compare `*toy
problem* <../T/toy-problem.html>`__, oppose
`*interesting* <../I/interesting.html>`__.
