**UN\*X**: n.

Used to refer to the Unix operating system (a trademark of AT&T, then of
Novell, then of Unix Systems Laboratories, then of the Open Group; the
source code parted company with it after Novell and was owned by SCO,
which was acquired by Caldera) in writing, but avoiding the need for the
ugly ™ typography (see also `*(TM)* <../0/TM.html>`__). Also used to
refer to any or all varieties of Unixoid operating systems. Ironically,
lawyers now say that the requirement for the trademark postfix has no
legal force, but the asterisk usage is entrenched anyhow. It has been
suggested that there may be a psychological connection to practice in
certain religions (especially Judaism) in which the name of the deity is
never written out in full, e.g., ‘YHWH’ or ‘G--d’ is used. See also
`*glob* <../G/glob.html>`__ and `*splat out* <../S/splat-out.html>`__.
