**Unix**: /yoo´niks/, n.

[In the authors' words, “A weak pun on Multics”; very early on it was
“UNICS”] (also “UNIX”) An interactive timesharing system invented in
1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project,
originally so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis
Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The
turning point in Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost
entirely in C during 1972—1974, making it the first source-portable OS.
Unix subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of
many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and
developer-friendly environment. By 1991, Unix had become the most widely
used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world — and since
1996 the variant called `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ has been at the
cutting edge of the `*open source* <../O/open-source.html>`__ movement.
Many people consider the success of Unix the most important victory yet
of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see `*Unix
weenie* <Unix-weenie.html>`__ and `*Unix
conspiracy* <Unix-conspiracy.html>`__ for an opposing point of view).
See `*Version 7* <../V/Version-7.html>`__, `*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__,
`*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__.

Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately ‘UNIX’
or ‘Unix’; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. Dennis
Ritchie says that the ‘UNIX’ spelling originally happened in CACM's 1974
paper *The UNIX Time-Sharing System* because “we had a new typesetter
and `*troff* <../T/troff.html>`__ had just been invented and we were
intoxicated by being able to produce small caps.” Later, dmr tried to
get the spelling changed to ‘Unix’ in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on
the grounds that the word is not acronymic. He failed, and eventually
(his words) “wimped out” on the issue. So, while the trademark today is
‘UNIX’, both capitalizations are grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon
File uses ‘Unix’ in deference to dmr's wishes.
