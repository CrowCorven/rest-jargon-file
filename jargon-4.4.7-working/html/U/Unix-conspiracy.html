**Unix conspiracy**: n.

[ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular among
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ and `*TOPS-20* <../T/TOPS-20.html>`__ fans,
Unix's growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell
Labs, whose intent was to hobble AT&T's competitors by making them
dependent upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&T's
control. This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system
that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively
unreliable and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from
AT&T). This theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper
referenced in the `*back door* <../B/back-door.html>`__ entry.

In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer viruses
(see `*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__) — but a virus spread to computers
indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly through
disks and networks. Adherents of this ‘Unix virus’ theory like to cite
the fact that the well-known quotation “Unix is snake oil” was uttered
by `*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ president Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC
began actively promoting its own family of Unix workstations. (Olsen now
claims to have been misquoted.)

If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
plotters' control after 1990. AT&T sold its Unix operation to Novell
around the same time `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ and other free-Unix
distributions were beginning to make noise.
