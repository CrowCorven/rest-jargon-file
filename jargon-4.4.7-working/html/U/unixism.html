**unixism**: n.

A piece of code or a coding technique that depends on the protected
multi-tasking environment with relatively low process-spawn overhead
that exists on virtual-memory Unix systems. Common
`*unixism* <unixism.html>`__\ s include: gratuitous use of fork(2); the
assumption that certain undocumented but well-known features of Unix
libraries such as stdio(3) are supported elsewhere; reliance on
`*obscure* <../O/obscure.html>`__ side-effects of system calls (use of
sleep(2) with a 0 argument to clue the scheduler that you're willing to
give up your time-slice, for example); the assumption that freshly
allocated memory is zeroed; and the assumption that fragmentation
problems won't arise from never free()ing memory. Compare
`*vaxocentrism* <../V/vaxocentrism.html>`__; see also `*New
Jersey* <../N/New-Jersey.html>`__.
