**Unix weenie**: n.

[ITS]

1. A derogatory play on ‘Unix wizard’, common among hackers who use Unix
by necessity but would prefer alternatives. The implication is that
although the person in question may consider mastery of Unix arcana to
be a wizardly skill, the only real skill involved is the ability to
tolerate (and the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and needless
complexity that is alleged to infest many Unix programs. “This shell
script tries to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways. It must have
been written by a real Unix weenie.”

2. A derogatory term for anyone who engages in uncritical praise of
Unix. Often appearing in the context “stupid Unix weenie”. See
`*Weenix* <../W/Weenix.html>`__, `*Unix
conspiracy* <Unix-conspiracy.html>`__. See also
`*weenie* <../W/weenie.html>`__.
