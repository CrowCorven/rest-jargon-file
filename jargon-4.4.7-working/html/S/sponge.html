**sponge**: n.

[Unix] A special case of a `*filter* <../F/filter.html>`__ that reads
its entire input before writing any output; the canonical example is a
sort utility. Unlike most filters, a sponge can conveniently overwrite
the input file with the output data stream. If a file system has
versioning (as ITS did and VMS does now) the sponge/filter distinction
loses its usefulness, because directing filter output would just write a
new version. See also `*slurp* <slurp.html>`__.
