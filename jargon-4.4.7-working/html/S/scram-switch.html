**scram switch**: n.

[from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off switch (see
`*Big Red Switch* <../B/Big-Red-Switch.html>`__), esp. one positioned to
be easily hit by evacuating personnel. In general, this is *not*
something you `*frob* <../F/frob.html>`__ lightly; these often initiate
expensive events (such as Halon dumps) and are installed in a `*dinosaur
pen* <../D/dinosaur-pen.html>`__ for use in case of electrical fire or
in case some luckless `*field servoid* <../F/field-servoid.html>`__
should put 120 volts across himself while `*Easter
egging* <../E/Easter-egging.html>`__. (See also
`*molly-guard* <../M/molly-guard.html>`__, `*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__.)

“Scram” was in origin a backronym for “Safety Cut Rope Axe Man” coined
by Enrico Fermi himself. The story goes that in the earliest nuclear
power experiments the engineers recognized the possibility that the
reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their mathematical
models. Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms in place
that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor. One
mechanism took the form of ‘scram technicians’. These individuals stood
next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the control rods.
Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood ready for
the (literal) ‘scram’ command. If necessary, they would cut the cables,
and gravity would expeditiously return the control rods to the reactor,
thereby averting yet another kind of `*core
dump* <../C/core-dump.html>`__.

Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,
held closed by current. SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that
immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid
insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.
