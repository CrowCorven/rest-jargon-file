**Stone Age**: n.,adj.

1. In computer folklore, an ill-defined period from ENIAC (ca. 1943) to
the mid-1950s; the great age of electromechanical
`*dinosaur* <../D/dinosaur.html>`__\ s. Sometimes used for the entire
period up to 1960--61 (see `*Iron Age* <../I/Iron-Age.html>`__);
however, it is funnier and more descriptive to characterize the latter
period in terms of a ‘Bronze Age’ era of transistor-logic,
pre-ferrite-`*core* <../C/core.html>`__ machines with drum or CRT mass
storage (as opposed to just mercury delay lines and/or relays). See also
`*Iron Age* <../I/Iron-Age.html>`__.

2. More generally, a pejorative for any crufty, ancient piece of
hardware or software technology. Note that this is used even by people
who were there for the `*Stone Age* <Stone-Age.html>`__ (sense 1).
