**Slowlaris**: /slo'·lahr·is/, n.

[Usenet; poss. from the variety of prosimian called a “slow loris”. The
variant ‘Slowlartus’ is also common, related to
`*LART* <../L/LART.html>`__] Common hackish term for Solaris, Sun's
System VR4 version of Unix that came out of the standardization wars of
the early 1990s. So named because especially on older hardware,
responsiveness was much less crisp than under the preceding SunOS. Early
releases of Solaris (that is, Solaris 2, as some
`*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__\ s at Sun retroactively
rechristened SunOS as Solaris 1) were quite buggy, and Sun was forced by
customer demand to support SunOS for quite some time. Newer versions are
acknowledged to be among the best commercial Unix variants in 1998, but
still lose single-processor benchmarks to Sparc
`*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__. Compare `*HP-SUX* <../H/HP-SUX.html>`__,
`*sun-stools* <sun-stools.html>`__.
