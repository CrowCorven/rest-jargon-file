**sharing violation**

[From a file error common to several `*OS* <../O/OS.html>`__\ es] A
response to receiving information, typically of an excessively personal
nature, that you were probably happier not knowing. “You know those
little noises that Pat makes in bed?” “Whoa! Sharing violation!” In
contrast to the original file error, which indicated that you were *not*
being given data that you *did* want.
