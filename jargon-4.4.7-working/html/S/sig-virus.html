**sig virus**: n.

A parasitic `*meme* <../M/meme.html>`__ embedded in a `*sig
block* <sig-block.html>`__. There was a `*meme
plague* <../M/meme-plague.html>`__ or fad for these on Usenet in late
1991. Most were equivalents of “I am a .sig virus. Please reproduce me
in your .sig block.”. Of course, the .sig virus's memetic hook is the
giggle value of going along with the gag; this, however, was a
self-limiting phenomenon as more and more people picked up on the idea.
There were creative variants on it; some people stuck ‘sig virus
antibody’ texts in their sigs, and there was at least one instance of a
sig virus eater.
