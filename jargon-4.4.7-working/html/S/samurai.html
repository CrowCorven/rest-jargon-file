**samurai**: n.

A hacker who hires out for legal cracking jobs, snooping for factions in
corporate political fights, lawyers pursuing privacy-rights and First
Amendment cases, and other parties with legitimate reasons to need an
electronic locksmith. In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence
of a loose-knit culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS
systems, mostly bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled
themselves explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the “net
cowboys” of William Gibson's `*cyberpunk* <../C/cyberpunk.html>`__
novels. Those interviewed claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to
their employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by
criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic; some
quote Miyamoto Musashi's *Book of Five Rings*, a classic of historical
samurai doctrine, in support of these principles. See also
