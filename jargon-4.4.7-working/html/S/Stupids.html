**Stupids**: n.

Term used by `*samurai* <samurai.html>`__ for the
`*suit* <suit.html>`__\ s who employ them; succinctly expresses an
attitude at least as common, though usually better disguised, among
other subcultures of hackers. There may be intended reference here to an
SF story originally published in 1952 but much anthologized since, Mark
Clifton's *Star, Bright*. In it, a super-genius child classifies humans
into a very few ‘Brights’ like herself, a huge majority of ‘Stupids’,
and a minority of ‘Tweens’, the merely ordinary geniuses.
