**splat**: n.

1. Name used in many places (DEC, IBM, and others) for the asterisk
(``*``) character (ASCII 0101010). This may derive from the
‘squashed-bug’ appearance of the asterisk on many early line printers.

2. [MIT] Name used by some people for the ``#`` character (ASCII
0100011).

3. The `*feature key* <../F/feature-key.html>`__ on a Mac (same as
`*alt* <../A/alt.html>`__, sense 2).

4. obs. Name used by some people for the Stanford/ITS extended ASCII ⊗
character. This character is also called blobby and frob, among other
names; it is sometimes used by mathematicians as a notation for tensor
product.

5. obs. Name for the semi-mythical Stanford extended ASCII ⊕ character.
See also `*ASCII* <../A/ASCII.html>`__.
