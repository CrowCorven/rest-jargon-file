**space-cadet keyboard**: n.

A now-legendary device used on MIT LISP machines, which inspired several
still-current jargon terms and influenced the design of
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__. It was equipped with no fewer than
*seven* shift keys: four keys for `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__ (‘control’, ‘meta’, ‘hyper’, and
‘super’) and three regular shift keys, called ‘shift’, ‘top’, and
‘front’. Many keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on
the top, and a Greek letter on the front. For example, the ‘L’ key had
an ‘L’ and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda on
the front. By pressing this key with the right hand while playing an
appropriate ‘chord’ with the left hand on the shift keys, you could get
the following results:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| L               | lowercase l                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| shift-L         | uppercase L                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| front-L         | λ                                 |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| front-shift-L   | Λ                                 |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| top-L           | ⇔ (front and shift are ignored)   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+

And of course each of these might also be typed with any combination of
the control, meta, hyper, and super keys. On this keyboard, you could
type over 8000 different characters! This allowed the user to type very
complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of
single-character commands at his disposal. The keyboard of the Symbolics
Lisp machine was a simplified version, lacking Top and Front keys, that
could only send about 2000 characters.

Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the command meanings of
that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude obviously
shaped the interface of EMACS). Other hackers, however, thought having
that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard can
require three or four hands to operate. See `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__,
`*cokebottle* <../C/cokebottle.html>`__, `*double
bucky* <../D/double-bucky.html>`__, `*meta bit* <../M/meta-bit.html>`__,
`*quadruple bucky* <../Q/quadruple-bucky.html>`__.

Simplified Symbolics version of the space-cadet keyboard

(Some relatively bad photographs of the earlier, more elaborate version
are `available on the
Web.) <http://screenshots.sourceforge.net/misc/SpaceCadet.html>`__.

Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
space-cadet keyboard with the Knight keyboard. Though both were designed
by Tom Knight, the latter term was properly applied only to a keyboard
used for ITS on the PDP-10 and modeled on the Stanford keyboard (as
described under `*bucky bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__). The true
space-cadet keyboard evolved from the first Knight keyboard.
