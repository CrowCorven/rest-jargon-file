**spool**: vi.

[from early IBM ‘Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line’, but is
widely thought to be a `*backronym* <../B/backronym.html>`__] To send
files to some device or program (a spooler) that queues them up and does
something useful with them later. Without qualification, the spooler is
the print spooler controlling output of jobs to a printer; but the term
has been used in connection with other peripherals (especially plotters
and graphics devices) and occasionally even for input devices. See also
`*demon* <../D/demon.html>`__.
