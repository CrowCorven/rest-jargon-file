**second-system effect**: n.

(sometimes, more euphoniously, second-system syndrome) When one is
designing the successor to a relatively small, elegant, and successful
system, there is a tendency to become grandiose in one's success and
design an `*elephantine* <../E/elephantine.html>`__ feature-laden
monstrosity. The term was first used by Fred Brooks in his classic *The
Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering* (Addison-Wesley,
1975; ISBN 0-201-00650-2). It described the jump from a set of nice,
simple operating systems on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360
series. A similar effect can also happen in an evolving system; see
`*Brooks's Law* <../B/Brookss-Law.html>`__, `*creeping
elegance* <../C/creeping-elegance.html>`__, `*creeping
featurism* <../C/creeping-featurism.html>`__. See also
`*Multics* <../M/Multics.html>`__, `*OS/2* <../O/OS-2.html>`__,
`*X* <../X/X.html>`__, `*software bloat* <software-bloat.html>`__.

This version of the jargon lexicon has been described (with altogether
too much truth for comfort) as an example of second-system effect run
amok on jargon-1....
