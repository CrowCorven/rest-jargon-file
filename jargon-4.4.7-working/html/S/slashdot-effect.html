**slashdot effect**: n.

1. Also spelled “/. effect”; what is said to have happened when a
website becoming virtually unreachable because too many people are
hitting it after the site was mentioned in an interesting article on the
popular `Slashdot <http://slashdot.org/>`__ news service. The term is
quite widely used by /. readers, including variants like “That site has
been slashdotted again!”

2. In a perhaps inevitable generation, the term is being used to
describe any similar effect from being listed on a popular site. This
would better be described as a `*flash
crowd* <../F/flash-crowd.html>`__. Differs from a `*DoS
attack* <../D/DoS-attack.html>`__ in being unintentional.
