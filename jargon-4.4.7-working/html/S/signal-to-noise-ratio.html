**signal-to-noise ratio**: n.

[from analog electronics] Used by hackers in a generalization of its
technical meaning. ‘Signal’ refers to useful information conveyed by
some communications medium, and ‘noise’ to anything else on that medium.
Hence a low ratio implies that it is not worth paying attention to the
medium in question. Figures for such metaphorical ratios are never
given. The term is most often applied to `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__
newsgroups during `*flame war* <../F/flame-war.html>`__\ s. Compare
`*bandwidth* <../B/bandwidth.html>`__. See also `*coefficient of
X* <../C/coefficient-of-X.html>`__, `*lost in the
noise* <../L/lost-in-the-noise.html>`__.
