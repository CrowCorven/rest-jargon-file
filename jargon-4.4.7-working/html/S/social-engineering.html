**social engineering**: n.

Term used among `*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__\ s and
`*samurai* <samurai.html>`__ for cracking techniques that rely on
weaknesses in `*wetware* <../W/wetware.html>`__ rather than software;
the aim is to trick people into revealing passwords or other information
that compromises a target system's security. Classic scams include
phoning up a mark who has the required information and posing as a field
service tech or a fellow employee with an urgent access problem. See
also the `*tiger team* <../T/tiger-team.html>`__ story in the
`*patch* <../P/patch.html>`__ entry, and `*rubber-hose
cryptanalysis* <../R/rubber-hose-cryptanalysis.html>`__.
