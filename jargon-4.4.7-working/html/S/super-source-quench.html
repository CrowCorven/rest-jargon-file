**super source quench**: n.

A special packet designed to shut up an Internet host. The Internet
Protocol (IP) has a control message called Source Quench that asks a
host to transmit more slowly on a particular connection to avoid
congestion. It also has a Redirect control message intended to instruct
a host to send certain packets to a different local router. A “super
source quench” is actually a redirect control packet, forged to look
like it came from a local router, that instructs a host to send all
packets to its own local loopback address. This will effectively tie
many Internet hosts up in knots. Compare
