**spelling flame**: n.

[Usenet] A posting ostentatiously correcting a previous article's
spelling as a way of casting scorn on the point the article was trying
to make, instead of actually responding to that point (compare
`*dictionary flame* <../D/dictionary-flame.html>`__). Of course, people
who are more than usually slovenly spellers are prone to think *any*
correction is a spelling flame. It's an amusing comment on human nature
that spelling flames themselves often contain spelling errors.
