**SCSI voodoo**: /skuz´ee voo´doo/

[common among Mac users] `*SCSI* <SCSI.html>`__ interface hardware is
notoriously fickle of temperament. Often, the SCSI bus will fail to work
unless the cable order of devices is re-arranged, SCSI termination is
added or removed (sometimes double-termination or *no* termination will
fix the problem), or particular devices are given particular SCSI IDs.
The skills needed to trick the naturally skittish demons of SCSI into
working are collectively known as SCSI voodoo. Compare
`*magic* <../M/magic.html>`__, `*deep magic* <../D/deep-magic.html>`__,
`*heavy wizardry* <../H/heavy-wizardry.html>`__, `*rain
dance* <../R/rain-dance.html>`__, `*cargo cult
programming* <../C/cargo-cult-programming.html>`__, `*wave a dead
chicken* <../W/wave-a-dead-chicken.html>`__, `*voodoo
programming* <../V/voodoo-programming.html>`__.

While ordinary mortals frequently experience near-terminal frustration
when attempting to configure SCSI device chains, it is said that a true
master of this arcane art can (through rituals involving chicken blood,
ground rhino horn, hairs of a virgin, eye of newt, etc.) hook up your
personal computer with three scanners, a Zip drive, an IDE hard drive, a
home weather station, a Smith-Corona typewriter, and the neighbor's
garage door.
