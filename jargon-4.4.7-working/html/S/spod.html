**spod**: n.

[UK]

1. A lower form of life found on `*talker
system* <../T/talker-system.html>`__\ s and
`*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__\ s. The spod has few friends in
`*RL* <../R/RL.html>`__ and uses talkers instead, finding communication
easier and preferable over the net. He has all the negative traits of
the computer geek without having any interest in computers per se.
Lacking any knowledge of or interest in how networks work, and
considering his access a God-given right, he is a major irritant to
sysadmins, clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs, following
passed-on instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet (“Wow! It's
in America!”) and complaining when he is not allowed to use busy routes.
A true spod will start any conversation with “Are you male or female?”
(and follow it up with “Got any good numbers/IDs/passwords?”) and will
not talk to someone physically present in the same terminal room until
they log onto the same machine that he is using and enter talk mode.
Compare `*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__,
`*tourist* <../T/tourist.html>`__, `*weenie* <../W/weenie.html>`__,
`*twink* <../T/twink.html>`__, `*terminal
junkie* <../T/terminal-junkie.html>`__, `*warez
d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__.

2. A `*backronym* <../B/backronym.html>`__ for “Sole Purpose, Obtain a
Degree”; according to some self-described spods, this term is used by
indifferent students to condemn their harder-working fellows. Compare
the defiant adoption of the term `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__ in the
mid-1990s by people who would previously have been stigmatized by it.
Spods in the positive sense are talker users who've accumulated a large
amount of spod time, that is, they spend a lot of time logged in to that
talker (for example, my spod time on Uberworld as of this moment is 131
days, 15 hours and 20 minutes). Spods are generally highly knowledgeable
about talkers and SGXStalker coding, as well as computers and the
internet in general.

3. [Glasgow University] An otherwise competent hacker who spends way too
much time on talker systems.

4. [obs.] An ordinary person; a `*random* <../R/random.html>`__. This is
the meaning with which the term was coined, but the inventor informs us
he has himself accepted sense 1.
