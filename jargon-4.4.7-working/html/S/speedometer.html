--------------

**speedometer**: n.

A pattern of lights displayed on a linear set of LEDs (today) or nixie
tubes (yesterday, on ancient mainframes). The pattern is shifted left
every ``N`` times the operating system goes through its `*main
loop* <../M/main-loop.html>`__. A swiftly moving pattern indicates that
the system is mostly idle; the speedometer slows down as the system
becomes overloaded. The speedometer on Sun Microsystems hardware bounces
back and forth like the eyes on one of the Cylons from the wretched
*Battlestar Galactica* TV series.

Historical note: One computer, the GE 600 (later Honeywell 6000)
actually had an *analog* speedometer on the front panel, calibrated in
instructions executed per second.
