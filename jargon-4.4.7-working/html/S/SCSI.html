**SCSI**: n.

[Small Computer System Interface] A bus-independent standard for
system-level interfacing between a computer and intelligent devices.
Typically annotated in literature with ‘sexy’ (/sek´see/), ‘sissy’
(/sis´ee/), and ‘scuzzy’ (/skuh´zee/) as pronunciation guides — the last
being the overwhelmingly predominant form, much to the dismay of the
designers and their marketing people. One can usually assume that a
person who pronounces it /S-C-S-I/ is clueless.
