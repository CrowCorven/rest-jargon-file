**state**: n.

1. Condition, situation. “What's the state of your latest hack?” “It's
winning away.” “The system tried to read and write the disk
simultaneously and got into a totally `*wedged* <../W/wedged.html>`__
state.” The standard question “What's your state?” means “What are you
doing?” or “What are you about to do?” Typical answers are “about to
gronk out”, or “hungry”. Another standard question is “What's the state
of the world?”, meaning “What's new?” or “What's going on?”. The more
terse and humorous way of asking these questions would be “State-p?”.
Another way of phrasing the first question under sense 1 would be
“state-p latest hack?”.

2. Information being maintained in non-permanent memory (electronic or
human).
