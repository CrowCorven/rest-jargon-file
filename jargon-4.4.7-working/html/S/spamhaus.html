**spamhaus**: spam´hows, n.

Pejorative term for an internet service provider that permits or even
encourages `*spam* <spam.html>`__ mailings from its systems. The plural
is spamhausen. There is a web page devoted to `tracking
spamhausen <http://www.spamhaus.org/>`__.

The most notorious of the spamhausen was Sanford Wallace's Cyber
Promotions Inc., shut down by a lawsuit on 16 October 1997. The
anniversary of the shutdown is celebrated on Usenet as Spam Freedom Day,
but lesser imitators of the Spamford still infest various murky corners
of the net. Since prosecution of spammers became routine under the
junk-fax laws and statues specifically targeting spam, spamhausen have
declined in relative importance; today, hit-and-run attacks by spammers
using `*relay rape* <../R/relay-rape.html>`__ and `*throwaway
account* <../T/throwaway-account.html>`__\ s on reputable ISPs seem to
account for most of the flow.
