**STR**

Spot the reference. Used in `*scary devil
monastery* <scary-devil-monastery.html>`__ to mark the witticism one
just uttered as a quote from some work of art or literature, the more
obscure the better. Those who know where the reference comes from reply
in the form “You are $CHARACTER, and you owe me $ITEM”, where $CHARACTER
is a character from the story being referenced and $ITEM is something
associated with that character. This acronym is never actually expanded
to its proper meaning in the newsgroup; posters instead use obscure
expansions, the most common being “slurp the robot”, leading to comments
like “I pulled my hair out, but couldn't figure out which robot you're
slurping”.
