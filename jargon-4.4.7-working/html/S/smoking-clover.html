**smoking clover**: n.

[ITS] A `*display hack* <../D/display-hack.html>`__ originally due to
Bill Gosper. Many convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in such
a way that every pixel struck has its color incremented. The lines all
have one endpoint in the middle of the screen; the other endpoints are
spaced one pixel apart around the perimeter of a large square. The color
map is then repeatedly rotated. This results in a striking,
rainbow-hued, shimmering four-leaf clover. Gosper joked about keeping it
hidden from the FDA (the U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration) lest its
hallucinogenic properties cause it to be banned.
