**superprogrammer**: n.

A prolific programmer; one who can code exceedingly well and quickly.
Not all hackers are superprogrammers, but many are. (Productivity can
vary from one programmer to another by three orders of magnitude. For
example, one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of
working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools, might be
able to write 3,000. This range is astonishing; it is matched in very
few other areas of human endeavor.) The term superprogrammer is more
commonly used within such places as IBM than in the hacker community. It
tends to stress naive measures of productivity and to underweight
creativity, ingenuity, and getting the job *done* — and to sidestep the
question of whether the 3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work
than three lines that do the `*Right Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__.
Hackers tend to prefer the terms `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__ and
`*wizard* <../W/wizard.html>`__.
