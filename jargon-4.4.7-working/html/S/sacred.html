**sacred**: adj.

Reserved for the exclusive use of something (an extension of the
standard meaning). Often means that anyone may look at the sacred
object, but clobbering it will screw whatever it is sacred to. The
comment “Register 7 is sacred to the interrupt handler” appearing in a
program would be interpreted by a hacker to mean that if any *other*
part of the program changes the contents of register 7, dire
consequences are likely to ensue.
