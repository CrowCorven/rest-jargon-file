**smoke test**: n.

1. A rudimentary form of testing applied to electronic equipment
following repair or reconfiguration, in which power is applied and the
tester checks for sparks, smoke, or other dramatic signs of fundamental
failure. See `*magic smoke* <../M/magic-smoke.html>`__.

2. By extension, the first run of a piece of software after construction
or a critical change. See and compare `*reality
check* <../R/reality-check.html>`__.

There is an interesting semi-parallel to this term among typographers
and printers: When new typefaces are being punch-cut by hand, a smoke
test (hold the letter in candle smoke, then press it onto paper) is used
to check out new dies.
