**suit**: n.

1. Ugly and uncomfortable ‘business clothing’ often worn by non-hackers.
Invariably worn with a ‘tie’, a strangulation device that partially cuts
off the blood supply to the brain. It is thought that this explains much
about the behavior of suit-wearers. Compare
`*droid* <../D/droid.html>`__.

2. A person who habitually wears suits, as distinct from a techie or
hacker. See `*pointy-haired* <../P/pointy-haired.html>`__,
