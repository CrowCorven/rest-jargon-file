**software laser**: n.

An optical laser works by bouncing photons back and forth between two
mirrors, one totally reflective and one partially reflective. If the
lasing material (usually a crystal) has the right properties, photons
scattering off the atoms in the crystal will excite cascades of more
photons, all in lockstep. Eventually the beam will escape through the
partially-reflective mirror. One kind of `*sorcerer's apprentice
mode* <sorcerers-apprentice-mode.html>`__ involving `*bounce
message* <../B/bounce-message.html>`__\ s can produce closely analogous
results, with a `*cascade* <../C/cascade.html>`__ of messages escaping
to flood nearby systems. By mid-1993 there had been at least two
publicized incidents of this kind.
