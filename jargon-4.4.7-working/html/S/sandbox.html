(also ‘sandbox, the’)

1. Common term for the R&D department at many software and computer
companies (where hackers in commercial environments are likely to be
found). Half-derisive, but reflects the truth that research is a form of
creative play. Compare `*playpen* <../P/playpen.html>`__.

2. Syn. `*link farm* <../L/link-farm.html>`__.

3. A controlled environment within which potentially dangerous programs
are run. Used esp. in reference to Java implementations.

4. A checked-out copy of a source tree, on which one may safely perform
builds without interfereing with others.
