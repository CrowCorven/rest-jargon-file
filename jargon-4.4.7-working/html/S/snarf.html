**snarf**: /snarf/, vt.

1. To grab, esp. to grab a large document or file for the purpose of
using it with or without the author's permission. See also
`*BLT* <../B/BLT.html>`__.

2. [in the Unix community] To fetch a file or set of files across a
network. See also `*blast* <../B/blast.html>`__. This term was
mainstream in the late 1960s, meaning ‘to eat piggishly’. It may still
have this connotation in context. “He's in the snarfing phase of hacking
— FTPing megs of stuff a day.”

3. To acquire, with little concern for legal forms or politesse (but not
quite by stealing). “They were giving away samples, so I snarfed a bunch
of them.”

4. Syn. for `*slurp* <slurp.html>`__. “This program starts by snarfing
the entire database into core, then....”

5. [GEnie] To spray food or `*programming
fluid* <../P/programming-fluid.html>`__\ s due to laughing at the wrong
moment. “I was drinking coffee, and when I read your post I snarfed all
over my desk.” “If I keep reading this topic, I think I'll have to
snarf-proof my computer with a keyboard
`*condom* <../C/condom.html>`__.” [This sense appears to be widespread
among mundane teenagers —ESR] The sound of snarfing is
`*splork!* <splork-.html>`__.
