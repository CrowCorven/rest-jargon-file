**Sturgeon's Law**: prov.

“Ninety percent of everything is crud”. Derived from a quote by science
fiction author Theodore Sturgeon, who once said, “Sure, 90% of science
fiction is crud. That's because 90% of everything is crud.” Sturgeon
himself called this “Sturgeon's Revelation”, and it first appeared in
the March 1958 issue of *Venture Science Fiction*; he gave Sturgeon's
Law as “Nothing is always absolutely so.” Oddly, when Sturgeon's
Revelation is cited, the final word is almost invariably changed to
‘crap’. Compare `*Hanlon's Razor* <../H/Hanlons-Razor.html>`__,
`*Ninety-Ninety Rule* <../N/Ninety-Ninety-Rule.html>`__. Though this
maxim originated in SF fandom, most hackers recognize it and are all too
aware of its truth.
