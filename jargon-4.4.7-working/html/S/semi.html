**semi**: /se´mee/, /se´mi:/

1. n. Abbreviation for ‘semicolon’, when speaking. “Commands to
`*grind* <../G/grind.html>`__ are prefixed by semi-semi-star” means that
the prefix is ``;;*``, not 1/4 of a star.

2. A prefix used with words such as ‘immediately’ as a qualifier. “When
is the system coming up?” “Semi-immediately.” (That is, maybe not for an
hour.) “We did consider that possibility semi-seriously.” See also
`*infinite* <../I/infinite.html>`__.
