**stone knives and bearskins**: n.

[from the Star Trek Classic episode *The City on the Edge of Forever*] A
term traditionally used to describe (and deprecate) computing
environments that are grotesquely primitive in light of what is known
about good ways to design things. As in “Don't get too used to the
facilities here. Once you leave SAIL it's stone knives and bearskins as
far as the eye can see”. Compare
