**samizdat**: /sahm·iz·daht/, n.

[Russian, literally “self publishing”] The process of disseminating
documentation via underground channels. Originally referred to
underground duplication and distribution of banned books in the Soviet
Union; now refers by obvious extension to any less-than-official
promulgation of textual material, esp. rare, obsolete, or
never-formally-published computer documentation. Samizdat is obviously
much easier when one has access to high-bandwidth networks and
high-quality laser printers. Note that samizdat is properly used only
with respect to documents which contain needed information (see also
`*hacker ethic* <../H/hacker-ethic.html>`__) but which are for some
reason otherwise unavailable, but *not* in the context of documents
which are available through normal channels, for which unauthorized
duplication would be unethical copyright violation. See `*Lions
Book* <../L/Lions-Book.html>`__ for a historical example.
