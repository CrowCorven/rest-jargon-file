**sigmonster**: n.

[common] A beast that randomly chooses one of a selection of signatures
for appending to mail and news messages. The creature is most often
mentioned directly when it has been in particularly good form and
selected a signature appropriate to the topic being discussed; the
construction “P.S.: good sigmonster, have a cookie” is not uncommon.
While the are sigmonster programs floating around on the net, most
hackers who keep one use a silly little Perl or Python script that they
threw together in the middle of the night under the influence of far too
much caffeine.
