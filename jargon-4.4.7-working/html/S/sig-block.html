**sig block**: /sig blok/, n.

[Internet and Usenet; often written ‘.sig’ there] Short for ‘signature’,
used specifically to refer to the electronic signature block that most
Unix mail- and news-posting software will
`*automagically* <../A/automagically.html>`__ append to outgoing mail
and news. The composition of one's sig can be quite an art form,
including an ASCII logo, one's choice of witty sayings (see `*sig
quote* <sig-quote.html>`__, `*fool file* <../F/fool-file.html>`__), or
even source code for small programs about which the author wishes to
make a statement; but many consider large sigs a waste of
`*bandwidth* <../B/bandwidth.html>`__, and it has been observed that the
size of one's sig block is usually inversely proportional to one's
longevity and level of prestige on the net. See also `*doubled
sig* <../D/doubled-sig.html>`__, `*McQuary
limit* <../M/McQuary-limit.html>`__.
