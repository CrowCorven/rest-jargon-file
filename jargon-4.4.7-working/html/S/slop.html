**slop**: n.

1. A one-sided `*fudge factor* <../F/fudge-factor.html>`__, that is, an
allowance for error but in only one of two directions. For example, if
you need a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess when you cut it,
you make very sure to cut it too long, by a large amount if necessary,
rather than too short by even a little bit, because you can always cut
off the slop but you can't paste it back on again. When discrete
quantities are involved, slop is often introduced to avoid the
possibility of being on the losing side of a `*fencepost
error* <../F/fencepost-error.html>`__.

2. The percentage of ‘extra’ code generated by a compiler over the size
of equivalent assembler code produced by
`*hand-hacking* <../H/hand-hacking.html>`__; i.e., the space (or maybe
time) you lose because you didn't do it yourself. This number is often
used as a measure of the goodness of a compiler; slop below 5% is very
good, and 10% is usually acceptable. With modern compiler technology,
esp. on RISC machines, the compiler's slop may actually be *negative*;
that is, humans may be unable to generate code as good. This is one of
the reasons assembler programming is no longer common.
