**spoiler**: n.

[Usenet]

1. A remark which reveals important plot elements from books or movies,
thus denying the reader (of the article) the proper suspense when
reading the book or watching the movie.

2. Any remark which telegraphs the solution of a problem or puzzle, thus
denying the reader the pleasure of working out the correct answer (see
also `*interesting* <../I/interesting.html>`__). Either sense readily
forms compounds like total spoiler, quasi-spoiler and even
pseudo-spoiler.

By convention, articles which are spoilers in either sense should
contain the word ‘spoiler’ in the Subject: line, or guarantee via
various tricks that the answer appears only after several screens-full
of warning, or conceal the sensitive information via
`*rot13* <../R/rot13.html>`__, `*spoiler space* <spoiler-space.html>`__
or some combination of these techniques.
