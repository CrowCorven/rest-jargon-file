**TECO**: /tee´koh/, n.,v. obs.

1. [originally an acronym for ‘[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector’;
later, ‘Text Editor and COrrector’] n. A text editor developed at MIT
and modified by just about everybody. With all the dialects included,
TECO may have been the most prolific editor in use before
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__, to which it was directly ancestral. Noted
for its powerful programming-language-like features and its unspeakably
`*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__ syntax. It is literally the case that
every string of characters is a valid TECO program (though probably not
a useful one); one common game used to be mentally working out what the
TECO commands corresponding to human names did.

2. vt. Originally, to edit using the TECO editor in one of its infinite
variations (see below).

3. vt.,obs. To edit even when TECO is *not* the editor being used! This
usage is rare and now primarily historical.

As an example of TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that takes a
list of names such as:

| 
|  Loser, J. Random
|  Quux, The Great
|  Dick, Moby

sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the
surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:

| 
|  Moby Dick
|  J. Random Loser
|  The Great Quux

The program is

| 
|  [1 J^P$L$$
|  J <.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L>$$

(where ^B means ‘Control-B’ (ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually an
`*alt* <../A/alt.html>`__ or escape (ASCII 0011011) character).

In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted list
from the first list. The first hack at it had a
`*bug* <../B/bug.html>`__: GLS (the author) had accidentally omitted the
**@** in front of **F^B**, which as anyone can see is clearly the
`*Wrong Thing* <../W/Wrong-Thing.html>`__. It worked fine the second
time. There is no space to describe all the features of TECO, but it may
be of interest that **^P** means ‘sort’ and **J<.-Z; ... L>** is an
idiomatic series of commands for ‘do once for every line’.

In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history, having
been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__. Descendants of an early (and somewhat
lobotomized) version adopted by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS
and a couple of crufty `*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ operating
systems, however, and ports of the more advanced MIT versions remain the
focus of some antiquarian interest. See also
`*retrocomputing* <../R/retrocomputing.html>`__, `*write-only
language* <../W/write-only-language.html>`__.
