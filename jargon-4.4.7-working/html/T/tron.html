**tron**: v.

[NRL, CMU; prob. fr. the movie *Tron*] To become inaccessible except via
email or talk(1), especially when one is normally available via
telephone or in person. Frequently used in the past tense, as in: “Ran
seems to have tronned on us this week” or “Gee, Ran, glad you were able
to un-tron yourself”. One may also speak of tron mode; compare
`*spod* <../S/spod.html>`__.

Note that many dialects of BASIC have a TRON/TROFF command pair that
enables/disables line number tracing; this has no obvious relationship
to the slang usage.
