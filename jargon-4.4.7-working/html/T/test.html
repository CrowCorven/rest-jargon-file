**test**: n.

1. Real users bashing on a prototype long enough to get thoroughly
acquainted with it, with careful monitoring and followup of the results.

2. Some bored random user trying a couple of the simpler features with a
developer looking over his or her shoulder, ready to pounce on mistakes.

Judging by the quality of most software, the second definition is far
more prevalent. See also `*demo* <../D/demo.html>`__.
