**terminal junkie**: n.

[UK] A `*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__ or early `*larval
stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__ hacker who spends most of his or her
time wandering the directory tree and writing
`*noddy* <../N/noddy.html>`__ programs just to get a fix of computer
time. Variants include terminal jockey, console junkie, and `*console
jockey* <../C/console-jockey.html>`__. The term console jockey seems to
imply more expertise than the other three (possibly because of the
exalted status of the `*console* <../C/console.html>`__ relative to an
ordinary terminal). See also `*twink* <twink.html>`__, `*read-only
user* <../R/read-only-user.html>`__. Appropriately, this term was used
in the works of William S. Burroughs to describe a heroin addict with an
unlimited supply.
