**toy language**: n.

A language useful for instructional purposes or as a proof-of-concept
for some aspect of computer-science theory, but inadequate for
general-purpose programming. `*Bad Thing* <../B/Bad-Thing.html>`__\ s
can result when a toy language is promoted as a general purpose solution
for programming (see `*bondage-and-discipline
language* <../B/bondage-and-discipline-language.html>`__); the classic
example is `*Pascal* <../P/Pascal.html>`__. Several moderately
well-known formalisms for conceptual tasks such as programming Turing
machines also qualify as toy languages in a less negative sense. See
also `*MFTL* <../M/MFTL.html>`__.
