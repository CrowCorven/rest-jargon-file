**tree-killer**: n.

[Sun]

1. A printer.

2. A person who wastes paper. This epithet should be interpreted in a
broad sense; ‘wasting paper’ includes the production of
`*spiffy* <../S/spiffy.html>`__ but
`*content-free* <../C/content-free.html>`__ documents. Thus, most
`*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__\ s are tree-killers.

It is likely that both senses derive their flavor from the epithet
‘tree-killer’ applied by Treebeard the Ent to the Orcs in J.R.R.
Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings*. See also `*elvish* <../E/elvish.html>`__,
`*elder days* <../E/elder-days.html>`__, and especially `*dead-tree
version* <../D/dead-tree-version.html>`__.
