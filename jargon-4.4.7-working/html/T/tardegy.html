**tardegy**: tar´d­jee, n.

[deliberate mangling of tragedy] An incident in which someone who
clearly deserves to be selected out of the gene pool on grounds of
extreme stupidity meets with a messy end. Coined on the Darwin list,
which is dedicated to chronicling such incidents; but almost all hackers
would instantly recognize the intention of the term and laugh.
