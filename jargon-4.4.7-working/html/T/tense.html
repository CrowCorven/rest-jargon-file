**tense**: adj.

Of programs, very clever and efficient. A tense piece of code often got
that way because it was highly tuned, but sometimes it was just based on
a great idea. A comment in a clever routine by Mike Kazar, once a
grad-student hacker at CMU: “This routine is so tense it will bring
tears to your eyes.” A tense programmer is one who produces tense code.
