**teledildonics**: /tel\`@·dil·do'·niks/, n.

Sex in a computer simulated virtual reality, esp. computer-mediated
sexual interaction between the `*VR* <../V/VR.html>`__ presences of two
humans. This practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited
form of erotic conversation on `*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__\ s and the
like. The term, however, is widely recognized in the VR community as a
`*ha ha only serious* <../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__ projection of
things to come. “When we can sustain a multi-sensory surround good
enough for teledildonics, *then* we'll know we're getting somewhere.”
See also `*hot chat* <../H/hot-chat.html>`__.
