**toy**: n.

A computer system; always used with qualifiers.

1. nice toy: One that supports the speaker's hacking style adequately.

2. just a toy: A machine that yields insufficient
`*computron* <../C/computron.html>`__\ s for the speaker's preferred
uses. This is not condemnatory, as is `*bitty
box* <../B/bitty-box.html>`__; toys can at least be fun. It is also
strongly conditioned by one's expectations; Cray XMP users sometimes
consider the Cray-1 a toy, and certainly all RISC boxes and mainframes
are toys by their standards. See also `*Get a real
computer!* <../G/Get-a-real-computer-.html>`__.
