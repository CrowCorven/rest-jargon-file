**tumbler**: n.

1. [Originally from the Xanadu hypertext project] A tumbler is a `*magic
cookie* <../M/magic-cookie.html>`__ generated as part of a record or
message to give it a unique identity. Usually a tumbler includes an
encoded form of its creation date, but if a software system has more
than one concurrent process that could generate tumblers it must also
include an encoding of the process ID. If tumblers will be shared across
multiple network hosts, they must also include the host name or network
address. Tumblers often include a hash of the rest of the message or
record content so that it is possible to verify the correctness of the
data the tumbler is attached to.

2. Variant text added to spam instances (often in the Subject line) to
make them unique. This kind of tumbler is used to defeat schemes that
check an exact hash of an incoming message against known spam
signatures; it also compromises some kinds of statistical spam
recognition.
