**tourist**: n.

1. [ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally logs in
over a network from a remote location for `*comm
mode* <../C/comm-mode.html>`__, email, games, and other trivial
purposes. One step below `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__. ITS hackers
often used to spell this `*turist* <turist.html>`__, perhaps by some
sort of tenuous analogy with `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__ (this usage
may also have expressed the ITS culture's penchant for six-letterisms,
and/or been some sort of tribute to Alan Turing). Compare
`*twink* <twink.html>`__, `*lurker* <../L/lurker.html>`__, `*read-only
user* <../R/read-only-user.html>`__.

2. [IRC] An `*IRC* <../I/IRC.html>`__ user who goes from channel to
channel without saying anything; see `*channel
hopping* <../C/channel-hopping.html>`__.
