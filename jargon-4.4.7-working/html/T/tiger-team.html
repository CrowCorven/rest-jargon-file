**tiger team**: n.

[U.S. military jargon]

1. Originally, a team (of `*sneaker* <../S/sneaker.html>`__\ s) whose
purpose is to penetrate security, and thus test security measures. These
people are paid professionals who do hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave
cardboard signs saying “bomb” in critical defense installations,
hand-lettered notes saying “Your codebooks have been stolen” (they
usually haven't been) inside safes, etc. After a successful penetration,
some high-ranking security type shows up the next morning for a
‘security review’ and finds the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks
loose. Serious successes of tiger teams sometimes lead to early
retirement for base commanders and security officers (see the
`*patch* <../P/patch.html>`__ entry for an example).

2. Recently, and more generally, any official inspection team or special
`*firefighting* <../F/firefighting.html>`__ group called in to look at a
problem.

A subset of tiger teams are professional
`*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__\ s, testing the security of military
computer installations by attempting remote attacks via networks or
supposedly ‘secure’ comm channels. Some of their escapades, if
declassified, would probably rank among the greatest hacks of all times.
The term has been adopted in commercial computer-security circles in
this more specific sense.
