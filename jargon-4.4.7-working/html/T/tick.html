**tick**: n.

1. A `*jiffy* <../J/jiffy.html>`__ (sense 1).

2. In simulations, the discrete unit of time that passes between
iterations of the simulation mechanism. In AI applications, this amount
of time is often left unspecified, since the only constraint of interest
is the ordering of events. This sort of AI simulation is often
pejoratively referred to as tick-tick-tick simulation, especially when
the issue of simultaneity of events with long, independent chains of
causes is `*handwave* <../H/handwave.html>`__\ d.

3. In the FORTH language, a single quote character.
