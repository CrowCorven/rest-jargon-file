**tentacle**: n.

A covert `*pseudo* <../P/pseudo.html>`__, sense 1. An artificial
identity created in cyberspace for nefarious and deceptive purposes. The
implication is that a single person may have multiple tentacles. This
term was originally floated in some paranoid ravings on the cypherpunks
list (see `*cypherpunk* <../C/cypherpunk.html>`__), and adopted in a
spirit of irony by other, saner members. It has since shown up, used
seriously, in the documentation for some remailer software, and is now
(1994) widely recognized on the net. Compare
`*astroturfing* <../A/astroturfing.html>`__, `*sock
puppet* <../S/sock-puppet.html>`__.
