**trampoline**: n.

An incredibly `*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__ technique, found in some
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__ and program-overlay implementations (e.g., on
the Macintosh), that involves on-the-fly generation of small executable
(and, likely as not, self-modifying) code objects to do indirection
between code sections. Under BSD and possibly in other Unixes,
trampoline code is used to transfer control from the kernel back to user
mode when a signal (which has had a handler installed) is sent to a
process. These pieces of `*live data* <../L/live-data.html>`__ are
called trampolines. Trampolines are notoriously difficult to understand
in action; in fact, it is said by those who use this term that the
trampoline that doesn't bend your brain is not the true trampoline. See
also `*snap* <../S/snap.html>`__.
