**thrash**: vi.

To move wildly or violently, without accomplishing anything useful.
Paging or swapping systems that are overloaded waste most of their time
moving data into and out of core (rather than performing useful
computation) and are therefore said to thrash. Someone who keeps
changing his mind (esp. about what to work on next) is said to be
thrashing. A person frantically trying to execute too many tasks at once
(and not spending enough time on any single task) may also be described
as thrashing. Compare `*multitask* <../M/multitask.html>`__.
