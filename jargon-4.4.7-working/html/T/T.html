**T**: /T/

1. [from LISP terminology for ‘true’] Yes. Used in reply to a question
(particularly one asked using `The -P
convention <../p-convention.html>`__). In LISP, the constant T means
‘true’, among other things. Some Lisp hackers use ‘T’ and ‘NIL’ instead
of ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ almost reflexively. This sometimes causes
misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a
hacker wants coffee, he may absently respond ‘T’, meaning that he wants
coffee; but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead.
Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese
restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee — so it is not that big
a problem.

2. See `*time T* <time-T.html>`__ (also `*since time T equals minus
infinity* <../S/since-time-T-equals-minus-infinity.html>`__).

3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for
the noun ‘transaction’.

4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of `*tee* <tee.html>`__.

5. A dialect of `*LISP* <../L/LISP.html>`__ developed at Yale. (There is
an intended allusion to NIL, “New Implementation of Lisp”, another
dialect of Lisp developed for the `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__)
