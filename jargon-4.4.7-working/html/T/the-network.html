**the network**: n.

1. Historically, the union of all the major noncommercial, academic, and
hacker-oriented networks, such as Internet, the pre-1990 ARPANET,
NSFnet, BITNET, and the virtual UUCP and `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__
‘networks’, plus the corporate in-house networks and commercial
timesharing services (such as CompuServe, GEnie and AOL) that gateway to
them. A site is generally considered on the network if it can be reached
through some combination of Internet-style (@-sign) and UUCP (bang-path)
addresses. See `*Internet* <../I/Internet.html>`__, `*bang
path* <../B/bang-path.html>`__, `*network
address* <../N/network-address.html>`__.

2. Following the mass-culture discovery of the Internet in 1994 and
subsequent proliferation of cheap TCP/IP connections, “the network” is
increasingly synonymous with the Internet itself (as it was before the
second wave of wide-area computer networking began around 1980).

3. A fictional conspiracy of libertarian hacker-subversives and
anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert Anton Wilson's
novel *Schrödinger's Cat*, to which many hackers have subsequently
decided they belong (this is an example of `*ha ha only
serious* <../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__).

In sense 1, the network is often abbreviated to the net. “Are you on the
net?” is a frequent question when hackers first meet face to face, and
“See you on the net!” is a frequent goodbye.
