**trit**: /trit/, n.

[by analogy with bit] One base-3 digit; the amount of information
conveyed by a selection among one of three equally likely outcomes (see
also `*bit* <../B/bit.html>`__). Trits arise, for example, in the
context of a `*flag* <../F/flag.html>`__ that should actually be able to
assume *three* values — such as yes, no, or unknown. Trits are sometimes
jokingly called 3-state bits. A trit may be semi-seriously referred to
as a bit and a half, although it is linearly equivalent to 1.5849625
bits (that is, log\_{2$(3)} bits).
