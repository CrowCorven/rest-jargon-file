**toaster**: n.

1. The archetypal really stupid application for an embedded
microprocessor controller; often used in comments that imply that a
scheme is inappropriate technology (but see `*elevator
controller* <../E/elevator-controller.html>`__).
“\ `*DWIM* <../D/DWIM.html>`__ for an assembler? That'd be as silly as
running Unix on your toaster!”

2. A very, very dumb computer. “You could run this program on any dumb
toaster.” See `*bitty box* <../B/bitty-box.html>`__, `*Get a real
computer!* <../G/Get-a-real-computer-.html>`__, `*toy* <toy.html>`__,
`*beige toaster* <../B/beige-toaster.html>`__.

3. A Macintosh, esp. a Mac in the original unitary case. Some hold that
this is implied by sense 2.

4. A peripheral device. “I bought my box without toasters, but since
then I've added two boards and a second disk drive.”

5. A specialized computer used as an appliance. See `*web
toaster* <../W/web-toaster.html>`__, `*video
toaster* <../V/video-toaster.html>`__.
