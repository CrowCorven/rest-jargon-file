**thread**: n.

[Usenet, GEnie, CompuServe] Common abbreviation of topic thread, a more
or less continuous chain of postings on a single topic. To follow a
thread is to read a series of Usenet postings sharing a common subject
or (more correctly) which are connected by Reference headers. The better
newsreaders can present news in thread order automatically. Not to be
confused with the techspeak sense of ‘thread’, e.g. a lightweight
process.

Interestingly, this is far from a neologism. The OED says: “That which
connects the successive points in anything, esp. a narrative, train of
thought, or the like; the sequence of events or ideas continuing
throughout the whole course of anything;” Citations are given going back
to 1642!
