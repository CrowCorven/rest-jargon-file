**nanotechnology**: /nan'·oh·tek·no\`l@·jee/, n.

A hypothetical fabrication technology in which objects are designed and
built with the individual specification and placement of each separate
atom. The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in
1990, for example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on a
nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large computer
company. Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture
ever since the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book *Engines
of Creation* (Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN 0-385-19973-2), where he predicted
that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers,
permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal wealth
(there's an authorized transcription at
`http://www.foresight.org/EOC/index.html <http://www.foresight.org/EOC/index.html>`__).
