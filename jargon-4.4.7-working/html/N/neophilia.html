**neophilia**: /nee\`oh·fil'·ee·@/, n.

The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most
hackers, SF fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge
subcultures, including the pro-technology ‘Whole Earth’ wing of the
ecology movement, space activists, many members of Mensa, and the
Discordian/neo-pagan underground (see `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__). All
these groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to
share characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction,
`*music* <../M/music.html>`__, and `*oriental
food* <../O/oriental-food.html>`__. The opposite tendency is neophobia.
