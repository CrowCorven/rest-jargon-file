**network address**: n.

(also net address) As used by hackers, means an address on ‘the’ network
(see `*the network* <../T/the-network.html>`__; this used to include
`*bang path* <../B/bang-path.html>`__ addresses but now always implies
an Internet address). Net addresses are often used in email text as a
more concise substitute for personal names; indeed, hackers may come to
know each other quite well by network names without ever learning each
others' ‘legal’ monikers. Display of a network address (e.g. on business
cards) used to function as an important hacker identification signal,
like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts among Grateful Dead
fans. In the day of pervasive Internet this is less true, but you can
still be fairly sure that anyone with a network address handwritten on
his or her convention badge is a hacker.
