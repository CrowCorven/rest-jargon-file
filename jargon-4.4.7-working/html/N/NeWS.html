**NeWS**: /nee´wis/, /n[y]oo´is/, /n[y]ooz/, n.

[acronym; the “Network Window System”] The road not taken in window
systems, an elegant `*PostScript* <../P/PostScript.html>`__-based
environment that would almost certainly have won the standards war with
`*X* <../X/X.html>`__ if it hadn't been
`*proprietary* <../P/proprietary.html>`__ to Sun Microsystems. There is
a lesson here that too many software vendors haven't yet heeded. Many
hackers insist on the two-syllable pronunciations above as a way of
distinguishing NeWS from Usenet news (the `*netnews* <netnews.html>`__
software).
