**neep-neep**: /neep neep/, n.

[onomatopoeic, widely spread through SF fandom but reported to have
originated at Caltech in the 1970s] One who is fascinated by computers.
Less specific than `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__, as it need not imply
more skill than is required to play games on a PC. The derived noun
neeping applies specifically to the long conversations about computers
that tend to develop in the corners at most SF-convention parties (the
term neepery is also in wide use). Fandom has a related proverb to the
effect that “Hacking is a conversational black hole!”.
