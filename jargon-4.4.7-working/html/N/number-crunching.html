**number-crunching**: n.

[common] Computations of a numerical nature, esp. those that make
extensive use of floating-point numbers. The only thing
`*Fortrash* <../F/Fortrash.html>`__ is good for. This term is in
widespread informal use outside hackerdom and even in mainstream slang,
but has additional hackish connotations: namely, that the computations
are mindless and involve massive use of `*brute
force* <../B/brute-force.html>`__. This is not always
`*evil* <../E/evil.html>`__, esp. if it involves ray tracing or fractals
or some other use that makes `*pretty
pictures* <../P/pretty-pictures.html>`__, esp. if such pictures can be
used as screen backgrounds. See also `*crunch* <../C/crunch.html>`__.
