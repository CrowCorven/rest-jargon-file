**newbie**: /n[y]oo´bee/, n.

[very common; orig. from British public-school and military slang
variant of ‘new boy’] A Usenet neophyte. This term surfaced in the
`*newsgroup* <newsgroup.html>`__ ``talk.bizarre`` but is now in wide use
(the combination “clueless newbie” is especially common). Criteria for
being considered a newbie vary wildly; a person can be called a newbie
in one newsgroup while remaining a respected regular in another. The
label newbie is sometimes applied as a serious insult to a person who
has been around Usenet for a long time but who carefully hides all
evidence of having a clue. See `*B1FF* <../B/B1FF.html>`__; see also
`*gnubie* <../G/gnubie.html>`__. Compare
`*chainik* <../C/chainik.html>`__, `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__.
