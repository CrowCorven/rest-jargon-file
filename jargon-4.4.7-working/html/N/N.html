**N**: /N/, quant.

1. A large and indeterminate number of objects: “There were ``N`` bugs
in that crock!” Also used in its original sense of a variable name:
“This crock has ``N`` bugs, as ``N`` goes to infinity.” (The true number
of bugs is always at least ``N + 1``; see `*Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic
Entomology* <../L/Lubarskys-Law-of-Cybernetic-Entomology.html>`__.)

2. A variable whose value is inherited from the current context. For
example, when a meal is being ordered at a restaurant, ``N`` may be
understood to mean however many people there are at the table. From the
remark “We'd like to order ``N`` wonton soups and a family dinner for
``N - 1``\ ” you can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat
only soup, even though you don't know how many people there are (see
`*great-wall* <../G/great-wall.html>`__).

3. ``Nth``: adj. The ordinal counterpart of ``N``, senses 1 and 2.

4. “Now for the ``N``\ th and last time...” In the specific context
“\ ``N``\ th-year grad student”, ``N`` is generally assumed to be at
least 4, and is usually 5 or more (see `*tenured graduate
student* <../T/tenured-graduate-student.html>`__). See also `*random
numbers* <../R/random-numbers.html>`__,
