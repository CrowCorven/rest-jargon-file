**network meltdown**: n.

A state of complete network overload; the network equivalent of
`*thrash* <../T/thrash.html>`__\ ing. This may be induced by a
`*Chernobyl packet* <../C/Chernobyl-packet.html>`__. See also
`*broadcast storm* <../B/broadcast-storm.html>`__, `*kamikaze
packet* <../K/kamikaze-packet.html>`__.

Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are optimized
for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well with the very
jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world. One amusing instance of
this is triggered by the popular and very bloody shoot-'em-up game
*Doom* on the PC. When used in multiplayer mode over a network, the game
uses broadcast packets to inform other machines when bullets are fired.
This causes problems with weapons like the chain gun which fire rapidly
— it can blast the network into a meltdown state just as easily as it
shreds opposing monsters.
