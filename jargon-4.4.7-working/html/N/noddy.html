**noddy**: /nod´ee/, adj.

[UK: from the children's books]

1. Small and un-useful, but demonstrating a point. Noddy programs are
often written by people learning a new language or system. The
archetypal noddy program is `*hello world* <../H/hello-world.html>`__.
Noddy code may be used to demonstrate a feature or bug of a compiler.
May be used of real hardware or software to imply that it isn't worth
using. “This editor's a bit noddy.”

2. A program that is more or less instant to produce. In this use, the
term does not necessarily connote uselessness, but describes a
`*hack* <../H/hack.html>`__ sufficiently trivial that it can be written
and debugged while carrying on (and during the space of) a normal
conversation. “I'll just throw together a noddy
`*awk* <../A/awk.html>`__ script to dump all the first fields.” In North
America this might be called a `*mickey mouse
program* <../M/mickey-mouse-program.html>`__. See `*toy
program* <../T/toy-program.html>`__.
