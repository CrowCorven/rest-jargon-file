**newsgroup**: n.

[Usenet] One of `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__'s huge collection of
topic groups or `*fora* <../F/fora.html>`__. Usenet groups can be
unmoderated (anyone can post) or moderated (submissions are
automatically directed to a moderator, who edits or filters and then
posts the results). Some newsgroups have parallel `*mailing
list* <../M/mailing-list.html>`__\ s for Internet people with no netnews
access, with postings to the group automatically propagated to the list
and vice versa. Some moderated groups (especially those which are
actually gatewayed Internet mailing lists) are distributed as digests,
with groups of postings periodically collected into a single large
posting with an index.

Among the best-known are ``comp.lang.c`` (the C-language forum),
``comp.arch`` (on computer architectures), ``comp.unix.wizards`` (for
Unix wizards), ``rec.arts.sf.written`` and siblings (for science-fiction
fans), and ``talk.politics.misc`` (miscellaneous political discussions
and `*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__).
