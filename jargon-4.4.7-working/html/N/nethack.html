**nethack**: /net´hak/, n.

[Unix] A dungeon game similar to `*rogue* <../R/rogue.html>`__ but more
elaborate, distributed in C source over `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__
and very popular at Unix sites and on PC-class machines (nethack is
probably the most widely distributed of the freeware dungeon games). The
earliest versions, written by Jay Fenlason and later considerably
enhanced by Andries Brouwer, were simply called ‘hack’. The name changed
when maintenance was taken over by a group of hackers originally
organized by Mike Stephenson. There is now an official site at
`http://www.nethack.org/ <http://www.nethack.org/>`__. See also
`*moria* <../M/moria.html>`__, `*rogue* <../R/rogue.html>`__,
`*Angband* <../A/Angband.html>`__.
