**not ready for prime time**: adj.

Usable, but only just so; not very robust; for internal use only. Said
of a program or device. Often connotes that the thing will be made more
solid `*Real Soon Now* <../R/Real-Soon-Now.html>`__. This term comes
from the ensemble name of the original cast of *Saturday Night Live*,
the “Not Ready for Prime Time Players”. It has extra flavor for hackers
because of the special (though now semi-obsolescent) meaning of `*prime
time* <../P/prime-time.html>`__. Compare `*beta* <../B/beta.html>`__.
