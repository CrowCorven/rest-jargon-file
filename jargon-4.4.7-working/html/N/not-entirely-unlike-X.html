**not entirely unlike X**

Used ironically of things which are in fact almost entirely unlike X,
except for one feature which the speaker clearly regards as
insignificant. “That is not entirely unlike cool...at least it's small.”
Comes directly from the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy scene in which
the food synthesizer on the starship *Heart of Gold* dispenses something
“almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea”.
