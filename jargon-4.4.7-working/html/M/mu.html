**mu**: /moo/

The correct answer to the classic trick question “Have you stopped
beating your wife yet?”. Assuming that you have no wife or you have
never beaten your wife, the answer “yes” is wrong because it implies
that you used to beat your wife and then stopped, but “no” is worse
because it suggests that you have one and are still beating her.
According to various Discordians and Douglas Hofstadter the correct
answer is usually “mu”, a Japanese word alleged to mean “Your question
cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions”. Hackers
tend to be sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and many have
adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm. The word ‘mu’ is actually from
Chinese, meaning ‘nothing’; it is used in mainstream Japanese in that
sense. In Chinese it can also mean “have not” (as in “I have not done
it”), or “lack of”, which may or may not be a definite, complete
'nothing'). Native speakers of Japanese do not recognize the Discordian
question-denying use, which almost certainly derives from
overgeneralization of the answer in the following well-known Rinzai Zen
`*koan* <../K/koan.html>`__:

    A monk asked Joshu, “Does a dog have the Buddha nature?” Joshu
    retorted, “Mu!”
