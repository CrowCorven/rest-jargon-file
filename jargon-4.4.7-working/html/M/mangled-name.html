**mangled name**: n.

A name, appearing in a C++ object file, that is a coded representation
of the object declaration as it appears in the source. Mangled names are
used because C++ allows multiple objects to have the same name, as long
as they are distinguishable in some other way, such as by having
different parameter types. Thus, the internal name must have that
additional information embedded in it, using the limited character set
allowed by most linkers. For instance, one popular compiler encodes the
standard library function declaration “memchr(const void\*,int,unsigned
int)” as “@memchr$qpxviui”.
