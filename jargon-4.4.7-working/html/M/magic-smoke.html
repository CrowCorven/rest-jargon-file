**magic smoke**: n.

A substance trapped inside IC packages that enables them to function
(also called blue smoke; this is similar to the archaic phlogiston
hypothesis about combustion). Its existence is demonstrated by what
happens when a chip burns up — the magic smoke gets let out, so it
doesn't work any more. See `*smoke test* <../S/smoke-test.html>`__,
`*let the smoke out* <../L/let-the-smoke-out.html>`__.

Usenetter Jay Maynard tells the following story: “Once, while hacking on
a dedicated Z80 system, I was testing code by blowing EPROMs and
plugging them in the system, then seeing what happened. One time, I
plugged one in backwards. I only discovered that *after* I realized that
Intel didn't put power-on lights under the quartz windows on the tops of
their EPROMs — the die was glowing white-hot. Amazingly, the EPROM
worked fine after I erased it, filled it full of zeros, then erased it
again. For all I know, it's still in service. Of course, this is because
the magic smoke didn't get let out.” Compare the original phrasing of
`*Murphy's Law* <Murphys-Law.html>`__.
