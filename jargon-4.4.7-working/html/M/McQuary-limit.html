**McQuary limit**

[from the name of the founder of ``alt.fan.warlord``; see
`*warlording* <../W/warlording.html>`__.] 4 lines of at most 80
characters each, sometimes still cited on Usenet as the maximum
acceptable size of a `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__. Before the
great bandwidth explosion of the early 1990s, long sigs actually cost
people running Usenet servers significant amounts of money. Nowadays
social pressure against long sigs is intended to avoid waste of human
attention rather than machine bandwidth. Accordingly, the McQuary limit
should be considered a rule of thumb rather than a hard limit; it's best
to avoid sigs that are large, repetitive, and distracting. See also
