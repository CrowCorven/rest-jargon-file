**marketroid**: /mar´k@·troyd/, n.

alt.: marketing slime, marketeer, mar­ket­ing droid, marketdroid. A
member of a company's marketing department, esp. one who promises users
that the next version of a product will have features that are not
actually scheduled for inclusion, are extremely difficult to implement,
and/or are in violation of the laws of physics; and/or one who describes
existing features (and misfeatures) in ebullient, buzzword-laden
adspeak. Derogatory. Compare `*droid* <../D/droid.html>`__.
