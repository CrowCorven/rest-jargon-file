**memory leak**: n.

An error in a program's dynamic-store allocation logic that causes it to
fail to reclaim discarded memory, leading to eventual collapse due to
memory exhaustion. Also (esp. at CMU) called `*core
leak* <../C/core-leak.html>`__. These problems were severe on older
machines with small, fixed-size address spaces, and special “leak
detection” tools were commonly written to root them out. With the advent
of virtual memory, it is unfortunately easier to be sloppy about wasting
a bit of memory (although when you run out of memory on a VM machine, it
means you've got a *real* leak!). See `*aliasing
bug* <../A/aliasing-bug.html>`__, `*fandango on
core* <../F/fandango-on-core.html>`__, `*smash the
stack* <../S/smash-the-stack.html>`__, `*precedence
lossage* <../P/precedence-lossage.html>`__, `*overrun
screw* <../O/overrun-screw.html>`__, `*leaky
heap* <../L/leaky-heap.html>`__, `*leak* <../L/leak.html>`__.
