**Microsloth Windows**: /mi:´kroh·sloth\` win´dohz/, n.

(Variants combine {Microshift, Macroshaft, Microsuck} with {Windoze,
WinDOS}. Hackerism(s) for ‘Microsoft Windows’. A thirty-two bit
extension and graphical shell to a sixteen-bit patch to an eight-bit
operating system originally coded for a four-bit microprocessor which
was written by a two-bit company that can't stand one bit of
competition. Also just called Windoze, with the implication that you can
fall asleep waiting for it to do anything; the latter term is extremely
common on Usenet. See `*Black Screen of
Death* <../B/Black-Screen-of-Death.html>`__ and `*Blue Screen of
Death* <../B/Blue-Screen-of-Death.html>`__; compare
`*X* <../X/X.html>`__, `*sun-stools* <../S/sun-stools.html>`__.
