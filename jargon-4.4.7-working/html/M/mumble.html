**mumble**: interj.

1. Said when the correct response is too complicated to enunciate, or
the speaker has not thought it out. Often prefaces a longer answer, or
indicates a general reluctance to get into a long discussion. “Don't you
think that we could improve LISP performance by using a hybrid
reference-count transaction garbage collector, if the cache is big
enough and there are some extra cache bits for the microcode to use?”
“Well, mumble ... I'll have to think about it.”

2. [MIT] Expression of not-quite-articulated agreement, often used as an
informal vote of consensus in a meeting: “So, shall we dike out the
COBOL emulation?” “Mumble!”

3. Sometimes used as an expression of disagreement (distinguished from
sense 2 by tone of voice and other cues). “I think we should buy a
`*`*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__* <../V/VAX.html>`__.” “Mumble!” Common
variant: mumble frotz (see `*frotz* <../F/frotz.html>`__; interestingly,
one does not say ‘mumble frobnitz’ even though ‘frotz’ is short for
‘frobnitz’).

4. Yet another `*metasyntactic
variable* <metasyntactic-variable.html>`__, like
`*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__.

5. When used as a question (“Mumble?”) means “I didn't understand you”.

6. Sometimes used in ‘public’ contexts on-line as a placefiller for
things one is barred from giving details about. For example, a poster
with pre-released hardware in his machine might say “Yup, my machine now
has an extra 16M of memory, thanks to the card I'm testing for
Mumbleco.”

7. A conversational wild card used to designate something one doesn't
want to bother spelling out, but which can be
`*glark* <../G/glark.html>`__\ ed from context. Compare
`*blurgle* <../B/blurgle.html>`__.

8. [XEROX PARC] A colloquialism used to suggest that further discussion
would be fruitless.
