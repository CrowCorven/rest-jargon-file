**munge**: /muhnj/, vt.

1. [derogatory] To imperfectly transform information.

2. A comprehensive rewrite of a routine, data structure or the whole
program.

3. To modify data in some way the speaker doesn't need to go into right
now or cannot describe succinctly (compare `*mumble* <mumble.html>`__).

4. To add `*spamblock* <../S/spamblock.html>`__ to an email address.

This term is often confused with `*mung* <mung.html>`__, which probably
was derived from it. However, it also appears the word munge was in
common use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in the 1950s, as a
verb, meaning to munch up into a masticated mess, and as a noun, meaning
the result of munging something up (the parallel with the
`*kluge* <../K/kluge.html>`__/`*kludge* <../K/kludge.html>`__ pair is
amusing). The OED reports “munge” as an archaic verb meaning “to wipe (a
person's nose)”.
