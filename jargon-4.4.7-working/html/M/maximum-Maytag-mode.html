**maximum Maytag mode**: n.

What a `*washing machine* <../W/washing-machine.html>`__ or, by
extension, any disk drive is in when it's being used so heavily that
it's shaking like an old Maytag with an unbalanced load. If prolonged
for any length of time, can lead to disks becoming `*walking
drives* <../W/walking-drives.html>`__. In 1999 it's been some years
since hard disks were large enough to do this, but the same phenomenon
has recently been reported with 24X CD-ROM drives.
