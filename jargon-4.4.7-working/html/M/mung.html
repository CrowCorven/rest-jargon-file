**mung**: /muhng/, vt.

[in 1960 at MIT, “Mash Until No Good”; sometime after that the
derivation from the `*recursive
acronym* <../R/recursive-acronym.html>`__ “Mung Until No Good” became
standard; but see `*munge* <munge.html>`__]

1. To make changes to a file, esp. large-scale and irrevocable changes.
See `*BLT* <../B/BLT.html>`__.

2. To destroy, usually accidentally, occasionally maliciously. The
system only mungs things maliciously; this is a consequence of
`*Finagle's Law* <../F/Finagles-Law.html>`__. See
`*scribble* <../S/scribble.html>`__, `*mangle* <mangle.html>`__,
`*trash* <../T/trash.html>`__, `*nuke* <../N/nuke.html>`__. Reports from
`*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ suggest that the pronunciation /muhnj/
is now usual in speech, but the spelling ‘mung’ is still common in
program comments (compare the widespread confusion over the proper
spelling of `*kluge* <../K/kluge.html>`__).

3. In the wake of the `*spam* <../S/spam.html>`__ epidemics of the
1990s, mung is now commonly used to describe the act of modifying an
email address in a sig block in a way that human beings can readily
reverse but that will fool an `*address
harvester* <../A/address-harvester.html>`__. Example:
johnNOSPAMsmith@isp.net.

4. The kind of beans the sprouts of which are used in Chinese food.
(That's their real name! Mung beans! Really!)

Like many early hacker terms, this one seems to have originated at
`*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__; it was already in use there in 1958. Peter
Samson (compiler of the original TMRC lexicon) thinks it may originally
have been onomatopoeic for the sound of a relay spring (contact) being
twanged. However, it is known that during the World Wars, ‘mung’ was
U.S.: army slang for the ersatz creamed chipped beef better known as
‘SOS’, and it seems quite likely that the word in fact goes back to
Scots-dialect `*munge* <munge.html>`__.

Charles Mackay's 1874 book *Lost Beauties of the English Language*
defined “mung” as follows: “Preterite of ming, to ming or mingle; when
the substantive meaning of mingled food of bread, potatoes, etc. thrown
to poultry. In America, ‘mung news’ is a common expression applied to
false news, but probably having its derivation from mingled (or mung)
news, in which the true and the false are so mixed up together that it
is impossible to distinguish one from another.”
