**MIPS**: /mips/, n.

[abbreviation]

1. A measure of computing speed; formally, ‘Million Instructions Per
Second’ (that's ``106`` per second, not ``220``!); often rendered by
hackers as ‘Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed’ or in other
unflattering ways, such as ‘Meaningless Information Provided by
Salesmen’. This joke expresses an attitude nearly universal among
hackers about the value of most `*benchmark* <../B/benchmark.html>`__
claims, said attitude being one of the great cultural divides between
hackers and `*marketroid* <marketroid.html>`__\ s (see also
`*BogoMIPS* <../B/BogoMIPS.html>`__). The singular is sometimes ‘1 MIP’
even though this is clearly etymologically wrong. See also
`*KIPS* <../K/KIPS.html>`__ and `*GIPS* <../G/GIPS.html>`__.

2. Computers, especially large computers, considered abstractly as
sources of `*computron* <../C/computron.html>`__\ s. “This is just a
workstation; the heavy MIPS are hidden in the basement.”

3. The corporate name of a particular RISC-chip company, later acquired
by SGI.

4. Acronym for ‘Meaningless Information per Second’ (a joke, prob.: from
sense 1).
