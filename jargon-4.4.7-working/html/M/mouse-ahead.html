**mouse ahead**: vi.

Point-and-click analog of type ahead. To manipulate a computer's
pointing device (almost always a mouse in this usage, but not
necessarily) and its selection or command buttons before a computer
program is ready to accept such input, in anticipation of the program
accepting the input. Handling this properly is rare, but it can help
make a `*WIMP environment* <../W/WIMP-environment.html>`__ much more
usable, assuming the users are familiar with the behavior of the user
interface.
