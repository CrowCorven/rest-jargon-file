mode bit

`Prev <mode.html>`__ 

M

 `Next <modulo.html>`__

--------------

**mode bit**: n.

[common] A `*flag* <../F/flag.html>`__, usually in hardware, that
selects between two (usually quite different) modes of operation. The
connotations are different from `*flag* <../F/flag.html>`__ bit in that
mode bits are mainly written during a boot or set-up phase, are seldom
explicitly read, and seldom change over the lifetime of an ordinary
program. The classic example was the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII bit (#12) of the
Program Status Word of the IBM 360.
