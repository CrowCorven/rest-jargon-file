**meta bit**: n.

The top bit of an 8-bit character, which is on in character values
128--255. Also called `*high bit* <../H/high-bit.html>`__, `*alt
bit* <../A/alt-bit.html>`__. Some terminals and consoles (see
`*space-cadet keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__) have a META
shift key. Others (including, *mirabile dictu*, keyboards on IBM
PC-class machines) have an ALT key. See also `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__.

Historical note: although in modern usage shaped by a universe of 8-bit
bytes the meta bit is invariably hex 80 (octal 0200), things were
different on earlier machines with 36-bit words and 9-bit bytes. The MIT
and Stanford keyboards (see `*space-cadet
keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__) generated hex 100 (octal
400) from their meta keys.
