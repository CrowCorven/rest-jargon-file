**magic**

1. adj. As yet unexplained, or too complicated to explain; compare
`*automagically* <../A/automagically.html>`__ and (Arthur C.) Clarke's
Third Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic.” “TTY echoing is controlled by a large number of magic
bits.” “This routine magically computes the parity of an 8-bit byte in
three instructions.”

2. adj. Characteristic of something that works although no one really
understands why (this is especially called `*black
magic* <../B/black-magic.html>`__).

3. n. [Stanford] A feature not generally publicized that allows
something otherwise impossible, or a feature formerly in that category
but now unveiled.

4. n. The ultimate goal of all engineering & development, elegance in
the extreme; from the first corollary to Clarke's Third Law: “Any
technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced”.

Parodies playing on these senses of the term abound; some have made
their way into serious documentation, as when a MAGIC directive was
described in the Control Card Reference for GCOS c.1978. For more about
hackish ‘magic’, see `Appendix A <../appendixa.html>`__. Compare `*black
magic* <../B/black-magic.html>`__, `*wizardly* <../W/wizardly.html>`__,
`*deep magic* <../D/deep-magic.html>`__, `*heavy
wizardry* <../H/heavy-wizardry.html>`__.
