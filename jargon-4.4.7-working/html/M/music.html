**music**: n.

A common extracurricular interest of hackers (compare `*science-fiction
fandom* <../S/science-fiction-fandom.html>`__, `*oriental
food* <../O/oriental-food.html>`__; see also
`*filk* <../F/filk.html>`__). Hackish folklore has long claimed that
musical and programming abilities are closely related, and there has
been at least one large-scale statistical study that supports this.
Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical appreciation in
unusual and interesting directions. Folk music is very big in hacker
circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of elaborate instrumental
jazz/rock that used to be called ‘progressive’ and isn't recorded much
any more. The hacker's musical range tends to be wide; many can listen
with equal appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat
Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny Ade,
The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti. It is also
apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher concentration of
talented amateur musicians than one would expect from a similar-sized
control group of `*mundane* <mundane.html>`__ types.
