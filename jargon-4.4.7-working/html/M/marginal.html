**marginal**: adj.

[common]

1. [techspeak] An extremely small change. “A marginal increase in
`*core* <../C/core.html>`__ can decrease `*GC* <../G/GC.html>`__ time
drastically.” In everyday terms, this means that it is a lot easier to
clean off your desk if you have a spare place to put some of the junk
while you sort through it.

2. Of little merit. “This proposed new feature seems rather marginal to
me.”

3. Of extremely small probability of `*win* <../W/win.html>`__\ ning.
“The power supply was rather marginal anyway; no wonder it fried.”
