**velveeta**: n.

[Usenet: by analogy with `*spam* <../S/spam.html>`__. The trade name
Velveeta is attached in the U.S. to a particularly nasty
processed-cheese spread.] Also knows as `*ECP* <../E/ECP.html>`__; a
message that is excessively cross-posted, as opposed to
`*spam* <../S/spam.html>`__ which is too frequently posted. This term is
widely recognized but not commonly used; most people refer to both kinds
of abuse as spam. Compare `*jello* <../J/jello.html>`__.
