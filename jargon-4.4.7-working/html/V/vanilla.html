**vanilla**: adj.

[from the default flavor of ice cream in the U.S.] Ordinary
`*flavor* <../F/flavor.html>`__, standard. When used of food, very often
does not mean that the food is flavored with vanilla extract! For
example, vanilla wonton soup means ordinary wonton soup, as opposed to
hot-and-sour wonton soup. Applied to hardware and software, as in
“Vanilla Version 7 Unix can't run on a vanilla 11/34.” Also used to
orthogonalize chip nomenclature; for instance, a 74V00 means what TI
calls a 7400, as distinct from a 74LS00, etc. This word differs from
`*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ in that the latter means
‘default’, whereas vanilla simply means ‘ordinary’. For example, when
hackers go on a `*great-wall* <../G/great-wall.html>`__, hot-and-sour
soup is the `*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ soup to get (because
that is what most of them usually order) even though it isn't the
vanilla (wonton) soup.
