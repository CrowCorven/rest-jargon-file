**videotex**: n. obs.

An electronic service offering people the privilege of paying to read
the weather on their television screens instead of having somebody read
it to them for free while they brush their teeth. The idea bombed
everywhere it wasn't government-subsidized, because by the time videotex
was practical the installed base of personal computers could hook up to
timesharing services and do the things for which videotex might have
been worthwhile better and cheaper. Videotex planners badly
overestimated both the appeal of getting information from a computer and
the cost of local intelligence at the user's end. Like the `*gorilla
arm* <../G/gorilla-arm.html>`__ effect, this has been a cautionary tale
to hackers ever since. See also `*vannevar* <vannevar.html>`__.
