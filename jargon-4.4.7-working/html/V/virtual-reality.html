**virtual reality**: n.

1. Computer simulations that use 3-D graphics and devices such as the
Dataglove to allow the user to interact with the simulation. See
`*cyberspace* <../C/cyberspace.html>`__.

2. A form of network interaction incorporating aspects of role-playing
games, interactive theater, improvisational comedy, and ‘true
confessions’ magazines. In a virtual reality forum (such as Usenet's
``alt.callahans`` newsgroup or the `*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__ experiments
on Internet), interaction between the participants is written like a
shared novel complete with scenery, foreground characters that may be
personae utterly unlike the people who write them, and common background
characters manipulable by all parties. The one iron law is that you may
not write irreversible changes to a character without the consent of the
person who ‘owns’ it. Otherwise anything goes. See
`*bamf* <../B/bamf.html>`__, `*cyberspace* <../C/cyberspace.html>`__,
`*teledildonics* <../T/teledildonics.html>`__.
