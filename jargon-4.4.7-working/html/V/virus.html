**virus**: n.

[from the obvious analogy with biological viruses, via SF] A cracker
program that searches out other programs and ‘infects’ them by embedding
a copy of itself in them, so that they become `*Trojan
horse* <../T/Trojan-horse.html>`__\ s. When these programs are executed,
the embedded virus is executed too, thus propagating the ‘infection’.
This normally happens invisibly to the user. Unlike a
`*worm* <../W/worm.html>`__, a virus cannot infect other computers
without assistance. It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading
programs with their friends (see `*SEX* <../S/SEX.html>`__). The virus
may do nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run
normally. Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it
starts doing things like writing cute messages on the terminal or
playing strange tricks with the display (some viruses include nice
`*display hack* <../D/display-hack.html>`__\ s). Many nasty viruses,
written by particularly perversely minded
`*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__\ s, do irreversible damage, like
nuking all the user's files.

In the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among Windows
users; the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to spread
easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by contrast,
are immune to such attacks). The production of special anti-virus
software has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated media
reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many
`*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__\ s tend to blame *everything* that doesn't
work as they had expected on virus attacks. Accordingly, this sense of
virus has passed not only into techspeak but into also popular usage
(where it is often incorrectly used to denote a
`*worm* <../W/worm.html>`__ or even a `*Trojan
horse* <../T/Trojan-horse.html>`__). See `*phage* <../P/phage.html>`__;
compare `*back door* <../B/back-door.html>`__; see also `*Unix
conspiracy* <../U/Unix-conspiracy.html>`__.
