**voodoo programming**: n.

[from George Bush Sr.'s “voodoo economics”]

1. The use by guess or cookbook of an `*obscure* <../O/obscure.html>`__
or `*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__ system, feature, or algorithm that one
does not truly understand. The implication is that the technique may not
work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why. Almost synonymous with
`*black magic* <../B/black-magic.html>`__, except that black magic
typically isn't documented and *nobody* understands it. Compare
`*magic* <../M/magic.html>`__, `*deep magic* <../D/deep-magic.html>`__,
`*heavy wizardry* <../H/heavy-wizardry.html>`__, `*rain
dance* <../R/rain-dance.html>`__, `*cargo cult
programming* <../C/cargo-cult-programming.html>`__, `*wave a dead
chicken* <../W/wave-a-dead-chicken.html>`__, `*SCSI
voodoo* <../S/SCSI-voodoo.html>`__.

2. Things programmers do that they know shouldn't work but they try
anyway, and which sometimes actually work, such as recompiling
everything.
