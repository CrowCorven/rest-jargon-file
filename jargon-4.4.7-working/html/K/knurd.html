**knurd**: n.

1. [RPI] Renssaleer Polytechnic Institute local slang roughly equivalent
to the positive sense of `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__, referring to
people who prefer technical hobbies to socializing.

2. In older usage at RPI, the term signified someone new to college
life, fresh out of high school, and wet behind the ears.

An IEEE Spectrum article (4/95, page 16) once derived ‘nerd’ in its
variant form ‘knurd’ from the word ‘drunk’ backwards; this etymology was
common at RPI. Though it is commonly confused with
`*nerd* <../N/nerd.html>`__, it appears these words have separate
origins (compare the `*kluge* <kluge.html>`__/`*kludge* <kludge.html>`__
pair).
